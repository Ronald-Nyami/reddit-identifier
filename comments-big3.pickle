V&gt;immigrants and visitors from China that don't and WON'T learn to speak English.\u000a\u000aThis is my only problem with living in Richmond. That, and that the immigrant Chinese always seem to segregate themselves from the Canadian-borns. Like, I've seen these community youth soccer teams JUST for Chinese kids. I understand that they may not be very good at english, but chances are on a normal community youth soccer team, there is probably a canadian-born chinese kid that can speak fluent english and chinese, so they can still have someone to talk to. Also, I have a hatred for Aberdeen mall. It's pretty well a fact that the canadian-born kids go to Richmond centre, and the immigrant kids go to aberdeen (no on goes to lansdowne, fyi).

VI say vice/sin/pleasure because idol worship, sexual immorality and meat from strangled animals all seem to be examples of those, so it follows that blood would fall into the same category.\u000a\u000aThe cited examples again refer to the eating or drinking of blooded meat and blood, not to blood transfusion. My interpretation is different than yours and I also don't study the Bible because I'm not religious. However, I might posit that (because blood transfusions are voluntary) one can make a gift of part of one's 'soul' to another in order to save their life.\u000a\u000aThe last point you make is somewhat unreasonable. I wouldn't inject bacon into my veins regardless of a doctor's opinion; likewise, I wouldn't reject lifesaving medical treatment. I also don't take issue with you personally choosing to reject blood transfusions; I only have problems when a child, who is unable to make their own decision, is refused medical treatment which could save his or her life.

VJust checked the mentioned passages, and in that context, I would interpret this as the drinking of human or animal blood as a vice/sin/pleasure.\u000a&gt;Acts 15:20 Instead we should write to them, telling them to abstain from food polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from the meat of strangled animals and from blood.\u000a\u000a&gt;Acts 21:25 As for the Gentile believers, we have written to them our decision that they should abstain from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals, and from sexual immorality.\u000a\u000aAgain, it's a matter of interpretation but I don't see this applying to blood transfusions.

VHe definitely has a lot to prove, but I think it quite likely he will emerge an effective point guard again.  He was playing really well on New York, was sent to Denver in the Gallo trade and never really found his grove there with Ty Lawson as the main guy.  He then got traded again to Portland, probably thought the season would be cancelled and got fat and played cruddy for the Trail Blazers.\u000a\u000aI reckon that being back in a place that actually wants him will be good for his confidence/motivation and will get in shape this offseason and have an overall better season than Lin would have.\u000a\u000aWe'll see what happens.

VHmm, but the question is overrated based on popular perception.  Maybe we hang around people with drastically different views on these players but what I always hear and generally believe is:\u000a\u000a* Johnson has a laughable contract, not overrated at all\u000a* Lopez has rebound numbers laughable for his size\u000a* Ibaka, great developing player\u000a* Bynum injury prone, great when he puts it together, but displayed major attitude issues last playoffs\u000a* Harden: developing Manu\u000a\u000aPeople are usually quite critical of both Johnson and Lopez, Ibaka is maybe a little overrated because his potential and ceiling are so high and people evaluate him on the player that he could become, Bynum is a bit of a mystery but I'd say he probably has more offensive tools than Dwight, and it's hard to tell with Harden since he's still in that 6th man role.

The most offensive (i found) thing about the place is a movie there called "Men in White," so don't watch that if you have high blood pressure.  They host a lot of speakers (who will try to sell you their books) so look online and try to figure out who is speaking, when, and if they'd interest you.  I had a ten min chat with the guy who gave the speech when I was there and he was friendly enough, wrong on every conceivable level, but friendly.  The only actual 'scientific proof' in there are some bits on Mt St Helens, Evolution vs Adaptation, and some panels on carbon dating next to the bathrooms.  Be prepared for a lot of wax figures of biblical scenes and what I would call a "scare chamber."  There are a whole lot of things to note, but I'll let you find the good/funny ones for yourself :)\u000a\u000aBring a camera, have a good time, and be prepared to laugh because if you don't you'll probably cry.

VI was working in a lab one smoldering hot summer and left at the same time as an older girl who worked there.  Both our cars were in the same lot so we walked together along the sidewalk and I started talking about Zaxbys for some reason.  I don't know how the conversation progressed but at some point I made a joke she didn't like and she gave me a playful elbow.  Maybe the elbow was less than playful, or maybe I spazz out at female body contact, but i topple off the sideway into the bikelane as a bus is passing by.  All I feel is a massive WOOSH and i thought of those god damn coors beer train commercials.

VExcept I have the same experiences of reddit and tech savvy circles so the accounts that are countering me are also integrated into my views.\u000a\u000a&gt;The discussion is not about the average person being able to troubleshoot problems with command line registry edits. We're talking about Facebook settings. Most people with cars know how to put their car into gear, and that you need to change the oil, and how to steer left and right.\u000a\u000aAnd that's where you're wrong. Many people can't drive manual. Of those, many people don't do it properly. Many people don't know how often their oil should be changed, what octane of fuel they should be using, how to negotiate a corner without crossing lanes, etc.\u000a\u000aThe large majority of Facebook users never touch their settings at all. They sign up, start adding people and apps and that's it.\u000a\u000aMy experience is not biased as the only people who aren't clients are people who are also techs. As someone who is a tech, I'm also friendly with many other computer techs. Being a repair guy doesn't just expose me to people who are completely computer illiterate. It exposes me to the inverse and everything in the middle as well.\u000a\u000aBeing able to turn on a PC and click Internet Explorer does not make one computer literate. The majority of people do just that.

VNot at all. People either give O'Reilly too much credit or don't give him enough, I can't really tell sometimes.\u000a\u000aAs he's gained more clout at Fox he's become less of a caricature and much less vitriolic. When he goes on the shows of ideological opponents to defend himself (which is admirable in its own) he does it in an assertive but respectable way. Stephen Colbert said in an interview that the most frustrating thing about O'Reilly is that he doesn't play his character when he's not on Fox News. He's a perfectly respectable and reasonable gentleman to his hosts and doesn't engage the way he does on his show (which, let's be fair, is his show and he can do what the fuck he wants on it).\u000a\u000aO'Reilly's show is his house and it's for his viewers. He plays a character there that is what his viewers expect. He can do whatever the hell he wants in his house. When he steps into someone else's house he tones it down and talks like any decent human being. I'm sure there are things you do in your home that you wouldn't do in another's.\u000a\u000aFactor O'Reilly and interview O'Reilly may seem like cognitive dissonance but it's just the turning off of the theatrics. He's a conservative and while you may not agree with him, he's extremely intelligent and self-aware. If you look closely at Factor O'Reilly vs interview O'Reilly you'll see he defends himself and his views much better and more articulately when he's not on his own show. There are times when he almost appears to "take a dive" on his show while arguing a more outrageous point of view. There are other times where he dances with words in ways that harshly criticize Fox News as an organization without saying it in and overt way that would get him fired.\u000a\u000aAgree with him or not, he deserves some amount of respect for not hiding behind Fox News like so many others.

VMeh. I always recommend browsing thrift stores and antique shops in that order looking for some really old Wagner or Griswold stuff that's lighter weight before buying new. The phrase "they don't make 'em like they used to" is not hyperbole when it comes to cast iron. It's law.\u000a\u000aIf you're patient you can usually find some extremely high quality stuff for just a few bucks at a thrift store. An antique store will usually have something really nice, sometimes even complete sets. The problem is, an antique store will know what they're worth so you'll have to actually pay something for them.

VSeriously, are there really people that use their touch-screen devices without screen protectors? A really good one is $20 max and preserves the resell value of your phone.\u000a\u000aThat said, I highly disagree on brand. The InvisibleShields are great for the Galaxy Nexus in that they're wet-application so they fit the obnoxious curves those Samsung geniuses put on the front surface. They also provide very sturdy protection. In every other regard they suck ass though.\u000a\u000aThe InivisibleShields are porous. They absorb oil over time. Pull one off after about a year of heavy use and it will have a strong orange tint. They're also far more "grippy" than the bare screen or other quality screen protectors made for touch-screens that require precision swiping. If you have very dry skin they're not bad, but if your have average or oily skin your finger will just hop.\u000a\u000aMy favorite screen protectors are [SPG.](http://www.spigen.com/) The Crystal model is my favorite. It's hard as glass. You can't tell it's there after a proper application unless you can see the edges. They're dry application though so it can't cover a curved surface.

VI disagree, I mentioned this in another thread and I'll explain it here as well.\u000a\u000aPizza Hut doesn't make "good pizza" in the same way Jack In The Box doesn't make "good tacos". But a Jack In The Box taco is a magical, delicious, greasy monstrosity. It's its own unique entity that is not to be compared with the larger taco spectrum. You don't eat it when you want a taco, you eat it when you want a *Jack In The Box* taco.\u000a\u000aPizza Hut pizzas are the Jack In The Box tacos of pizza. Nobody thinks, "I could go for an awesome slice of pizza" and thinks Pizza Hut. Pizza Hut makes greasy, drippy, delicious, disgusting, and unwieldy pizza products with superfluous shit jammed into the crust. They're to be smashed into the faces of drunk men watching football, not admired for their culinary artwork. As soon as you remove Pizza Hut products from the spectrum of good to bad pizza it's quite enjoyable.\u000a\u000aI'm the same way with Sbarro. Something about their slices are just fucking magical. I don't appreciate them for their pizza quality, but for the unique texture and taste that's all their own.\u000a\u000aThis is in contrast to other pizza chains that instead of making all their own unique product, try to make decent pizza and fall short.

I use them for taking on-site credit card payments for PC repair and they're fantastic. There's a few drawbacks for larger businesses like monthly collection limits but they're still quite a young company so expect to see them expand as time goes on.\u000a\u000aAmazon Payments used to be alright before they started requiring SSNs for US users even if they weren't doing business transactions.

Even then it's not that impressive.\u000a\u000aI was going to build a DYI cell phone belt case with solar panels on it to charge it when facing the sun and walking about. I learned a lot about solar panel power-per-cm. That doesn't have dimensions listed but from the looks of things it's about the dimensions I was working with. The max theoretical I could get was right about what the specs list, but in real-world testing I got nowhere near that on even a hazy day. Even in direct sunlight it was spotty.\u000a\u000aI'm going to have to call bullshit on this. It looks like it's geared towards home use which really doesn't have any practical purpose. You can charge a phone from any outlet or USB port. I'll go out on a limb and say pretty much everyone has one of those at home and the circumstances surrounding a situation where your power would be out but you'd have direct sunlight are not exactly something you'd expect even annually.\u000a\u000aThere are dozens of outdoor-oriented solar chargers out there which have MUCH better power output and surface area for less-than-ideal conditions.

You only have yourself to blame for wrapping yourself up in this retarded us vs them race that politics has become.\u000a\u000aHere's a concept, we're all fucking Americans. This is not a war. This is not a fight. There is not one side trying to destroy the country and one side trying to fix it, despite how much better it makes you feel about your positions to believe that.\u000a\u000aI personally voted for Gary Johnson. However, had my choice been only Obama or Romney I'd have voted for Obama a thousand times before pledging a single vote for Romney. I vote for moderates specifically because of the attitude of people like you who look at politics as a fight. Unfortunately the national GOP doesn't exist in a state that allows for moderate politics anymore. They seem to believe, like you, that they're the champions of American values and everyone else who disagrees with their view of American values is the enemy and is not worthy of input.\u000a\u000aA vote for a moderate, in my opinion, is a vote for someone who's got a grasp on reality and the fact that no matter what the majority vote is, there are still millions who would like something different. There are very few situations in life where an extreme is the correct course. Politics is the most important example of this. **YOU** may have this shining example of what you think America should be or has been in the past. Your opinion is not the only opinion or necessarily the correct one.\u000a\u000aStop calling everyone who disagrees with you unamerican.\u000a\u000aStop legislating from a magic book. Believe what you want, fuck off with your laws based on those beliefs.\u000a\u000aStop touting deregulation while trying to regulate people's personal lives.\u000a\u000aStop regurgitating verbatim arguments that were used against blacks during segregation, replacing black with gay.\u000a\u000aThen maybe, just maybe we can finally get to the parts of the GOP platform that could actually be beneficial to the country in some way.

VSo, the "far right clowns" are not responsible because Obama ignored the "reasonable conservatives" like the House majority leader John Boehner who has consistently spoken about "winning" and absolutely refused to compromise on *anything* unless he gets his way on *everything.* That is not compromise.\u000a\u000aIf you can't include the House majority leader as a far right clown in your argument, I don't know who you can. He's been completely quiet during the election and with good reason, his department's approval rating is in the twenty percents. Him speaking up for a candidate would be electoral suicide so the presidential GOP has distanced themselves from him.\u000a\u000aWhen GOP politicians are signing en masse a pledge to not raise taxes under any circumstances whatsoever, we have not a lack of compromise but anti-compromise.\u000a\u000aYou're trying really hard to pretend that this GOP extreme right shift is some kind of fringe movement. Luckily I can say in my state it is. Our republican gubernatorial candidate was one hell of a fantastic moderate compared to his democratic counterpart. I voted republican in my local election because the republican candidates were much closer to center than the democratic candidates.\u000a\u000aLike the fact or not, but Obama is a very moderate president compared to the modern national GOP. I voted libertarian in the presidential election as I'm in a blue state and my vote wouldn't have done anything productive for a primary candidate. If my vote would have counted though, and I had to choose between Romney or Obama, my choice would be Obama every time.\u000a\u000aAs an oversimplified example using guns and gays:\u000a\u000aWhen Obama was first elected there was a massive ammo shortage in the US. By massive I don't mean it was sort of hard to get bullets. I mean it was a **massive** fucking ammo shortage. The price of quality ammo doubled and it disappeared from shelves for **months.**\u000a\u000aThis was out of fears peddled by the GOP and their lap dog, the NRA, that Obama was gunna TAKE 'R GUNZ!\u000a\u000aGuess which part of that sentence never happened? All of it except for the ammo shortage.\u000a\u000aNow, an opposite end of this extreme is the Washington gubernatorial race. Rob McKenna, the republican candidate, was asked what his stance on gay marriage was by a church. He dismissed it completely saying that such religious matters aren't for government to decide and that any vote by the people on the matter should be respected as law. He said he had more important issues to tackle and those were the issues he was going to campaign on, not those of the church.\u000a\u000aHe was completely thrown under the bus in a bunch of opinion articles by the religious right for that sentiment. He absolutely stuck by it, though, and it may have cost him the election. Liberal opinion writers tried their hardest to paint him as a fringe GOP candidate but he just isn't. He was assaulted from both sides.\u000a\u000aThis is the plight of the center. Nobody can be moderate anymore. Everyone on the other side is an extremist. Unfortunately much of the republican party takes pride in extremism these days and they have to deal with that reputation or extinguish it to start recovering moderate voters. That's not to say there aren't extremist liberals, but you don't see their batshit crazy messages praised as much by public officials.\u000a\u000aThe republican party won't gain another presidency until they learn that the extreme religious right is no longer enough to win an election. \u000a\u000aSource: Ted Nugent.

My agreement with the underlying principles has nothing to do with their accuracy.\u000a\u000aIt's a sick and selfish mentality required to think that littering up an entire town (again, not hyperbole, these signs are on an unrealistic amount of poles) is justified to support your cause when realistically you're not going to be changing anyone's mind.\u000a\u000aThere are dozens of signs I absolutely abhor which are anti ref 74 around my neighborhood because there's a Catholic church nearby. They're on private property and they're just expressing their freedom of speech. I wouldn't think of touching them.

I've had my share of compromising situations and bad judgement when drinking. As a result of that experience (when I was in a teenager or in my early 20s) I know myself and my reaction to alcohol. Just because you act like a college frat boy at age 30 doesn't mean everyone else does.\u000a\u000aAs a contrast, I would never carry while under the influence of marijuana even a little bit. I know for a fact that my reaction times with even a small amount in me are unacceptable for the safe handling of a firearm. I don't attribute this to everyone because I know there are people who can smoke marijuana and do fucking balance beam flips while reciting the alphabet backwards. My experience is not the experience of everyone.\u000a\u000aBecause you get drunk and try to fuck every fat chick in sight doesn't mean everyone else has the same piss poor judgement as you do.

VConsistent tethering will use as much or more battery power than screen-on time if you turn the screen brightness down to minimum. Remember that wifi and 3G radios are large power draws when active. Usually you're using one or the other. When tethering you have both going at equal activity rates.\u000a\u000aIf you do this right your largest power draw will be 3G, not screen time. Turn your screen down as much as possible without turning the backlight off. Turn off all non-essential features, force close all background data apps like Google Talk, turn off sync, etc. Only use the screen to check up on stuff and try to remember your way.\u000a\u000aCarry your charger with you. Most bars will let you charge your phone even if it's behind the bar. Most bars have receptacles just on the inside of the bar for small appliances. Whenever you stop, hit airplane mode to kill the power draw and ask to plug it in somewhere. The Galaxy Nexus charges extremely quickly when plugged into a socket. Disabling all radios will speed that up marginally. If you can manage to not leave your phone behind you'll end up getting plenty of power on your stops to make up for the journeys in between.\u000a\u000aTry to get a good spot at the bar, be really nice the bartender, tip well and you'll find plenty of spots that will let you charge up. You'll be fine.

VFor future reference, to quote, place a &gt; in front of the line. Reddit uses a stripped version of [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).\u000a\u000a&gt;Please don't: Complain about other users reposting/rehosting stories, images, videos, or any other content. **Users should give credit where credit should be given**, but if someone fails to do so, and is not causing harm whatsoever, please either don't point it out, or point it out politely and leave it at that. They are only earning karma, which has little to no use at all.\u000a\u000a&gt;I'd say that this repost was pointed out to be a repost quite politely. The guy didn't even add any commentary, he just posted information that showed it was a repost-- nothing more, nothing less.\u000a\u000aYou're confusing linking a source with pointing out reposts. Linking to those previous posts does not lead back to an original source. The context that this paragraph is addressing would be analogous to someone hosting a comic on imgur and someone else linking to the original author's page in the comments so they can get credit for their work. That is absolutely useful and should be done at every opportunity. Linking previous posts which are all also hosted on imgur is not contributing anything to the discussion and is only covered by the first sentence of your quote.\u000a\u000aThat is where your entire argument falls apart.

VYou're saying that selling below cost kills competition. The entire console market is built on selling as many units as possible below cost and recovering profits later.\u000a\u000aTechnology that was one inaccessible has become ubiquitous for nearly everyone in the first world. Companies are going to find ways to drive costs down to sell as many units as possible making sure it's *their* product that is ubiquitous with a certain market. Hardware manufacturers can do this if they don't get stuck in the rut of a mentality I see in this thread from folks like you which is that their business model *should* be viable so people who succeed by other means are doing something wrong.\u000a\u000aThere are untapped hardware markets out there that are being completely ignored by manufacturers. If they truly want to compete they can step out of five years ago and start finding new and interested ways to fill consumer demand.\u000a\u000aNobody is crying for Blockbuster because they got shit all over by Netflix while digging their heels into a dying business model. How can anyone argue that the Nexus line is killing competition when there is no viable competition to the Nexus line made independently from any hardware manufacturer? The Nexus devices aren't just a success simply because of the price. The Nexus is a success because it stands unchallenged as no manufacturer has the balls to release a vanilla Android phone without it being officially endorsed by the Nexus brand. Something that there's *obviously* a market for. And surprise! The time and effort manufacturers put into this modified software that a large cross section of the Android community doesn't want costs them great resources to make!\u000a\u000aQuality accessories are another completely untapped market in the world of Android. The best Android phone dock to date was released by Google for the Galaxy Nexus. If manufacturers who know their devices better than anyone would take a cue from Apple and make a high quality, high markup line of quality peripherals which works flawlessly with the devices they themselves manufacture they could apply a modest subsidy to their devices from that.\u000a\u000aWal Mart is a horrible example. The products and services Wal Mart offers aren't any better that their competition in any way. They only niche they're filling is low prices. Google fills a market demand with the Nexus line that nobody else is willing to do. Doing it at a lower price is just a bonus.\u000a\u000aDon't cry for companies which refuse to move forward and take risks. If Google thought like that we wouldn't have Android in the first place.

VIn WA it's considered to mean all firearms, including CCW holders. However they don't carry the weight of law in that you're only subject to prosecution after someone has asked you to leave and you refuse, in which case it's a trespassing charge, not a firearms related charge. So someone who's carrying concealed can go anywhere it's not prohibited by state or federal law without risk of being prosecuted. So long as you keep your weapon concealed, nobody has the opportunity to ask you to leave.\u000a\u000aThis is the way I think it should be. Property owners have the right to enforce their wishes on people who are on *their* property. Everyone else has the right to go the fuck someplace else. It doesn't leave loopholes for CCW permit holders to get fucked over by ambiguous signage laws.\u000a\u000aThat said, the government shouldn't be mandating places you can't carry.

But I still decided to turn around and walk another 500' to another establishment to spend my money where they don't actively put up signage to prohibit firearms.\u000a\u000aI respect the right of private property owners to set their own rules for the property *they own*.

VI'm about 5'10" 160 and I carry a 1911 Officer's ACP. It's not a full size, but it's exactly the same as a full size 1911 save for the barrel length. The only thing keeping me from carrying my full length 1911 is the barrel digs into the seat when I sit down when carrying in my Supertuck Deluxe.\u000a\u000aThe problem is, as a small guy I have to carry the pistol low on my belt line to keep it from sticking out around where my torso narrows. The size of the pistol isn't an issue, just the length. If I've no need to sit down I can carry any size pistol.\u000a\u000aOP, try out a low riding IWB holster with a good, wide, leather belt. and see how that suits you.

V&gt;The devotion of the large breweries to product quality is the ONLY reason that you can get a consistent craft beer today. There was no science put behind yeast and microbiological spoilage organisms until THEY did the research and discovered it. There would be no standards for cleanliness without them. People wouldn't know that diacetyl could be produced by latent alpha-acetolactate after beer was bottled. People wouldn't understand that if you ferment the same yeast at different temperatures, you can get completely different flavors. The big brewers developed the methods to detect and identify spoilage organisms in a brewery. Why does the same type of hop lend different bitterness at different times? Because of what they learned, we know that the alpha acid % is what determines bitterness. Without any of this knowledge, the craft brewing industry would not be anywhere close to where it is today because nobody could brew the strong, complex brews that craft brewers make.\u000a\u000aUhg, I hate this shit-tastic arguments in any context.\u000a\u000a&gt;**THESE GUYS DID IT AND IF THEY DIDN'T NOBODY EVER WOULD HAVE DONE IT AND YOU WOULDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT!**\u000a\u000aFucking nonsense.

VI'm not sure I can blame her. Because of the black-is-bigger stereotype, a black dude can't really get into porn unless he's absolutely huge. You see plenty of slightly above average white guys, but whenever it's a black guy it's always "...GIANT BLACK DICK...". It's sort of an unfortunate typecasting thing I guess. I imagine all the of the black guys who she could reasonably expected to do a scene with would all be well above what she could expect from their white colleagues in penis size.\u000a\u000aOr she could be a wild racist, who knows.

VUhg, this thread is making me cringe...\u000a\u000aA few things to clear up. This is *not* a slow and low BBQ cut. My brain is full of fuck at all the people calling this a fatty cut of meat. It's not even well marbled.\u000a\u000aFor slow and low on the BBQ to make pulled pork or beef, you want very well marbled meat with a **fat cap.** The fat melts and keeps the meat moist and flavorful. This cut of meat does not have a decent fat cap and does not have enough marbling to stay moist in the BBQ up to 190F. All of that advice is absolutely horrible!\u000a\u000aI do smoked pulled pork and briskets regularly and I can tell you that nobody in /r/smoking or /r/BBQ would condone using a cut like this to make pulled anything.\u000a\u000aYou can still smoke it. I smoke tritip beef which is slightly more well marbled than this but I do it at about 300F so it will finish before it dries out. Usually in a couple hours. I also dry brine it to help hold in moisture. If you're not going to be adding any smoke though, putting it on the BBQ is fairly pointless.\u000a\u000aGo with the braising. There are a few good recipes posted here. For fuck's sake, though, don't let these people convince you this is a fatty cut of meat...

VThat wasn't a joke, but OK. If you intended it to be a joke...\u000a\u000aLet me explain... well, everything to you.\u000a\u000aThe original joke was not derogatory in any way. If you don't like any racial jokes at all in any context then so be it. Don't laugh at them and move on with your life like mentally healthy people do. If you can't see a racial joke without flipping your fucking gasket and taking it in the worst possible context, it sounds like you're the fragile one here. Here's a fun fact, it's possible to not find something funny without getting your fragile little psyche offended and playing some sort of pathetic victim while lashing out for attention.\u000a\u000a&gt;I make it plain that I do not like racial jokes.\u000a\u000aYou paraphrased the quote into something that wasn't said to take it to the most possible extreme context for your own selfish victim needs. You put words in someone else's mouth. Then you signed off with "Fuckin' reddit", which is the go-to line of the internet blow-hard who marginalizes the entire community, falsely elevating themselves above the rest as if they have some sort of moral or intellectual superiority. You're like those SRS folks. Find something that could possible be taken as offensive, reframe it in the most extreme possible context, act like some sort of victim because someone said something that offends you then somehow twist people disagreeing into them being weak or stupid.\u000a\u000a&gt;People downvote me. The question is, why do people experience such a response when they see somebody else speak a contrary opinion? Obviously, the fact that I don't like something that they like affected them enough to want to cast a vote on it.\u000a\u000aSays the guy who clicked the *reply* button to type up an extremist, paraphrased lie to satisfy his own sense of moral superiority instead of just clicking on the simple downvote button. One of these things takes more effort than the other and you're using the lesser one as indication of some sort of profound impact on their lives when in reality it's just people rolling their eyes in pity of the person who is so delicate that he can't go on about his life without letting each and every person know what is offending his glass sensibilities.\u000a\u000a&gt;And here you come, tossing names around and telling me I don't have a sense of humor simply because I do not find the same things funny as you do.\u000a\u000aQuite wrong, there. I called you a humorless cunt not because you don't find it funny, but because you got offended by it and felt the need to publicly rage about it like some internet Gloria Allred. There are a lot of things I don't find funny. Not a single one of them are things I let get to me and I don't let myself get offended because I was born with the ability to realize that the bullshit people say doesn't affect me unless I actively choose to let it.\u000a\u000a&gt;Why did it piss you off to see that I don't find racial jokes amusing? Who knows! I just assumed it pissed you off because your ego is fragile enough that contrary voices make you cry out, downvote, and cast insults around.\u000a\u000aYou seem to be under the assumption that anyone is mad at you. This is a common tactic I see around the internet by the supremely butthurt. You're mad so you're projecting what you feel on everyone who disagrees with you. \u000a\u000aAnd you should really learn a bit more about what it means to have a fragile ego if you want to keep using that as your go-to straw to grasp at. It doesn't at all fit in this context.

V&gt;You're right in that inferior styluses would probably have to be used with the Nexus.\u000a\u000aIt's not really inferior styluses, it's the touch-screen technology not being appropriate for writing. I currently use a capacitive stylus for my Nexus to take credit card signatures. It's absolutely horrible looking and not exactly confidence inspiring for clients. The Note II uses wacom for the stylus which gives it infinitely superior accuracy over standard capacitive touch-screens. If it weren't for that existing this would be an easy choice.\u000a\u000aI use my phone for taking on-site credit card payments and because of that I need highly reliable data. That's what sunk the Sprint ship to begin with. I'm not sure what pre-paid services offer for data price and reliability, but T-Mobile has made me an offer through their business plans which is a good deal cheaper than their personal plans and gives me business level support. If I were going to go sans-contract I'd do the unlocked Play Store purchase and take it to T-Mobile and ask them to give me a plan on that phone.\u000a\u000aI didn't realized the GN was no longer offered though. The Nexus 4 is kind of a deal breaker for me. I would be halving my storage with no SD card slot and an unremovable battery. There's no way to paint that in a positive light. I like the Galaxy Nexus better. Perhaps I am destined to end up with a Note 2.

Last time I owned a GSM phone was before color screens.\u000a\u000aDoes this have to do with the radio frequency or is the restricted data something that can be overcome by getting an unlock code from one of the various companies that offer the service?\u000a\u000a&gt;Also, you are right that the S-Pen does not usually work well with custom ROMs.\u000a\u000a&gt;I'm an OG Galaxy Note owner.

All the S-Pen apps still work, and I get the launcher I wanted.\u000a\u000aI figured this would be the case. I'll be installing ADW/EX immediately if I go the Note 2 route.

That will give you a misplaced confidence when putting it back together.\u000a\u000aLaptop bezels are often paper thin around the screw holes. It takes only a decent gust of wind on the screwdriver to drive the screw head right through the fucking bezel.\u000a\u000aI learned that one the hard way. Now I keep a compartment of my tool box full of various size cardboard gaskets and stick-on rubber nibs.\u000a\u000aScrew carefully!

VI played STO off and on since day-1 of beta testing. I actually hold the most unique title in the game, only ever given to a small handfull of beta testers recognized for being awesome.\u000a\u000aThe game was a pretty great initial letdown. The thing looked absolutely ridiculous. Like a TRON themed... something. Space combat was fun, ground combat was tedious and awful. The only redeeming quality was some of the awesome story lines in the non-filler missions. But we all know most MMO players don't follow what's actually going on in missions so that didn't matter much for subs.\u000a\u000aThere have been a great many improvements over time and it's quite a playable game now. To me it suffers from number-bloat syndrome. Too many currencies, too many experience bars, too many pointless meta-games that have no actual content.\u000a\u000a&gt;I am weird though because I was excited to experience the opportunity to play as an engineer and not as a captain. It seemed to me that the true experience of Star Trek is the unity of the different sections combined and working together to explore, not just explore as the ship itself.\u000a\u000aThat was a big concern with people in beta. Think about this from a marketing point of view though. This is not a Trek sim. This is an MMO. They had to keep subscribers and most of those subscribers are going to by gamers first and Trek fans second. To be a viable mass-market game it had to have action at the core. Possibly the most sim-like (popular) Trek game ever done, Bridge Command, was still at it's core you controlling the ship to fight the bad guys.\u000a\u000aYou have to be realistic in your expectations of a game they're targeting the general population of gamers with.\u000a\u000aIf you want my advice for how to get the most out of STO as a Trek fan, hop in and play through [the episodes.](http://sto.perfectworld.com/about/feature-episodes) They're quite good and give you good rewards (although I believe they got rid of the leveling gear you could get from them, I may be wrong)\u000a\u000aAlso pick up primary storyline missions. I haven't played early content in a long time so I don't know how they've branded these now. You used to be able to tell by who was giving you the missions. The whole Doomsday Machine mission series is absolutely fucking awesome. There is a distinct difference between the filler side missions and the primary storyline missions.

I was settled on an every-other-release upgrade plan so I would have skipped the Nexus4 anyhow.\u000a\u000aBut I'm getting more and more attracted to the Note 2 for business related purposes. Being able to scribble stuff down, draw simple schematics and take signatures with the S-Pen would be a huge deal for me.

VI lived in a house with about four room mates. People came and went. I was around 20.\u000a\u000aA girl who one of my room mates had met at a bar and hooked up with weeks prior had come over with a couple of her friends, one being a very naive and already drunk 18 year old who really shouldn't have been drinking. We were all hanging out and drinking around the fire on the deck. The little one got completely sloppy drunk and was put to bed on a cot in a friend's bedroom. We were always pretty adamant about taking care of people who were drunk and not letting people fuck with them. Her two friends kept insisting that none of us take advantage of the drunk passed out one even though nobody had ever implied it was a possibility.\u000a\u000aFast forward a couple hours in the night and I'm walking inside to take a piss. While peeing I hear this horrible noise that I can't really describe. It sounded like vomiting but without the heaving, and a little bit of gargling.\u000a\u000aSo I went into the bedroom to investigate the noise and drunk girl was passed out laying on her back. She had shit herself and pissed herself, but what's more is that she'd thrown up but was still laying face up coughing on the vomit and choking, struggling to breathe through her mouth and nose full of puke.\u000a\u000aI immediately turned her on her side, spilling vomit all over the room. I ran out to tell her friends what was going on thinking that they would be worried about their friend but I was met with a resounding "Meh, she does this all the time, just leave her". I was absolutely appalled.\u000a\u000aAnother roomate and myself kept going inside every five minutes or so to check on her, occasionally having to tilt her back on her side to keep her from drowning in her own vomit. I kept insisting her friends go inside to check on her and call her an ambulance but they refuse to even take a fucking look. Eventually I was shouting at them to take care of their fucking friend and calling them shitty cunts but not a fucking feel was had between the both of them.\u000a\u000aEventually I got fed up with the girl who could easily die in my house who was laying in her own piss and shit and told her friends if they didn't go check on her I would be calling 911 and they could explain why they weren't caring for her.\u000a\u000aAfter much rolling of eyes at my melodrama they finally came inside, saw the state she was in, then started shouting at me saying they were going to call the police and tell them I'd done this to her...\u000a\u000aI immediately called 911 to report a possible alcohol poisoning. EMTs came, checked her vitals, said she was OK and were about to leave. I stopped one of them on the way out asking if it was safe if she were to be left with people who were not caring for her. He shrugged, didn't care too much and left.\u000a\u000aWe tried to get them to clean her up in the shower so she didn't have to walk home with cold piss and shit caking her pants but they refused, insisting on leaving right away.\u000a\u000aWas a fucked up night...

V&gt;They are one of the five big competitors in the US market, and it would be poor business discretion for them to lag behind any of the other providers. Just make the leap.\u000a\u000aThat sounds like it would be a reasonable assumption, but Verizon proves it's just not the reality :(\u000a\u000a&gt;Read the fine-print. I was texting someone I knew in Ontario and got charged out the wazoo because I assumed "unlimited texting" covered everything.\u000a\u000aYikes... because it's out of country? There are a couple of people in Canada I text. It's quite rare... Perhaps using Google Voice would mitigate this? Usually Canada is included in unlimited calling/texting plans.\u000a\u000aCarrier apps are the main reason I ever install custom ROMs. The Note II does look awesome but I have quite a bit of research to do on it. In theory it seems like I wouldn't be able to install a custom ROM on it as the wacom hardware would require specific drivers from Samsung. Third party apps may not take advantage of the wacom hardware. So I may get stuck with a bunch of carrier apps which infuriates me if I can't install a custom ROM.

VA teaspoon... Maybe if you actually cut it with a knife.\u000a\u000aGo ahead and cook two steaks of identical cut and marbling. Poke one and not the other. Weight them on a highly sensitive digital scale. Check the weight loss.\u000a\u000aThe simple fact here is that moisture is lost by rupturing cell membranes and severing muscle fiber connections, not by inserting a needle-thin probe.

VI question how much meat you've actually cooked. If you think that meat is bleeding a fuck ton of juices out then you don't understand the actual science behind your cooking, just what you read on some blog somewhere.\u000a\u000aPoking does no "pop" the meat, as you say. As geodebug says, it's not a water balloon. There is no magical membrane on the outside of a cut of steak. Searing it does not create any kind of membrane unless you're burning on a sugar crust. Even then, it's not going to contain moisture like you're suggesting. The only barrier that's developed on your steak is a dry zone while you're in the process of searing it\u000a\u000aThe surface area created by a needle-thin temperature probe is statistically insignificant compared to the surface area of the rest of the steak. The surface area you're creating does not have some sort of new, magical physical properties which allow all of the juices within the steak to migrate inward to it. The juices you're releasing are only the juices which were contained inside the few cells you ruptured to get the probe in. If you're inserting your probe with the grain and your steak is properly cut then it's completely a non-issue.\u000a\u000aSince the surface area created by the poke is no different than the surface area of the rest of the steak, if inserting a probe were causing issues with leaking juices then the entire steak would just bleed out in seconds and soon as it hit the grill. This is not the case though.\u000a\u000aA bit of science and common sense applied to cooking debunks a lot of myths. Yes, most "steak chef" blogs will tell you not to poke your steak. If you read any serious cooking blogs where the writer actually tests methods and posts recorded results instead of listing recipes and regurgitating myths you'll learn that a lot of what most "good cooks" hold as truth is just rooted in old wives tales.

V&gt;I cant tell if youre being sarcastic or not.\u000a\u000aHow can you not tell if I'm being sarcastic there? It's two very simple points.\u000a\u000a&gt;So I take it you fancy yourself an expert who has had a proper steak? Can I ask your favorite way to cook a steak?\u000a\u000aSure.\u000a\u000a1. Get a prime ~2" boneless ribeye. Generously salt it and let sit in the fridge for a couple hours.\u000a\u000a2. Get your (charcoal) grill up to temp with a 200-225F cool zone while the steak is brining.\u000a\u000a3. Throw some wood chips over the coals from a potent hard wood like like mesquite, hickory or oak.\u000a\u000a4. Place the steak on the cool side of the grill where it can get plenty of smoke until it hits 105F\u000a\u000a5. While the steak is warming make another small batch of coals.\u000a\u000a6. When the steak hits 105F, remove the grate and add the fresh coals to the hot side of the grill and stir them up to get them as hot as possible. Position them as absolutely close to the grill as possible. Completely open your bottom vent. You want the surface of your grill well over 600F. The hotter the better. Mine is usually around 800F for this step.\u000a\u000a7. Gently pat the steak dry with a paper towel then completely paint with melted butter or olive oil depending on your taste. You can add a little more salt if you really like salt.\u000a\u000a8. Sear the steak for about three minutes on one side. Re-paint the top then flip.\u000a\u000a9. Re-paint the cooked side and add pepper. Sear and remove before the steak reaches 125F.\u000a\u000aPerfect steak.

VHa, thanks. I actually skimped on the technical details as I didn't want to dump four paragraphs of technical details in a sub where people wouldn't understand making my post hard to relate to. I don't work in the cellular industry but I know my tech.\u000a\u000a&gt;Also, "green on her end" is a rather subjective thing. There's any number of things that could be happening at the site to cause bandwidth issues. Until a Tech checks the site that you are having issues with, they don't know everything's ok. Hell even when I was having problems with TMO that ended up being due to my phone they sent a tech out to the tower.\u000a\u000aYea, I understand that. I actually have a very good signal. I always have around here. 3/4 bars. 3G doesn't sputter in and out or lose connection. My connection to the towers for voice and 3G is great. The actual problem is specifically the downstream speed. I'll explain more below.\u000a\u000aThis isn't an isolated issue. The GFs Evo has the same issue and I've sampled friends and random people in the area to check 3G speeds. Many of them aren't tech savvy so they just chalk it up to whatever and wait till they get within wifi coverage. I know better.\u000a\u000a&gt;That said, If you aren't having actual disruption of calls or 'dropped data' i.e. pages not loading at all, you'll have limited leverage. FCC Takes complaints about E911 being unusable very seriously. The further you get from that level of badness the less leverage you have. Thus, a situation like this may have you wind up in mediation hell.\u000a\u000aThe thing is I only have data service by the strictest technical definition. As I said above, 3G is connected and it doesn't have disconnection issues. What I have is specifically downstream issues. From within my city limits [this is completely average 3G speed](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3047594/Screenshot_2012-10-24-18-55-53.png).\u000a\u000aThat may not mean much to someone without networking knowledge but 8kbps is not a low level of service. It is a null level of service. It is not possible to use it. People in the late 80s had better internet connections over TandyLink. A Google search will time out before you get a server response at 8kbps. This is city-wide. If I go north or south a city, or take a boat over to Seattle my 3G speeds are completely tolerable.\u000a\u000aI actually took my phone in to a tech at a Sprint shop yesterday as requested by support. I was actually glad to do this as I wanted someone who knew their shit to give my phone a complete diagnostic. He verified (as I knew) there was nothing wrong with my phone and said they were working on upgrades across the entire peninsula (which is true according to the Sprint tower map web site) but nobody could possibly know when they'd be complete or if they'd return me to an acceptable level of service. When in the shop with him my speeds were slow but acceptable. I was able to show him logs from SpeedTest.net though which he agreed were completely inappropriate.\u000a\u000a&gt;Tips: -You're about to have to be a huge, huge, huge ass. If you have an issue justifying it, you may want to stop now. All I will say on the subject is that I work in the industry and I feel the behavior below is plenty justified based on my knowledge of the inner workings of the industry.\u000a\u000aThis is actually the whole part that I hate. I've worked in customer service and I've worked in retail. I know how much it sucks to have someone holding the sword to your throat like that when it's undeserved. On the flip side of that coin, working in those industries I've also learned that being a massive fucking asshole is also how you get results, and sometimes special treatment. I've made peace with the fact that I'm not *that guy* and I'll just have to pay a little bit more or deal with slightly shittier customer service as a result. \u000a\u000aHowever this interferes with my business. I take credit card payments using Square over my phone. This is about professionalism. If I'm swiping a customer's card and have to make excuses for why it doesn't work, that's a problem with my business. If a customer is out in the fucking sticks I can say "I'm sure you understand that there's no coverage out here, so if you can't provide secure wifi I'll have to run the card back at the office or take cash or check". If I'm in the middle of the city that excuse just doesn't fly. Who the fuck is this tech guy (I do on-site PC repair) who can't even get his mobile internet working right?\u000a\u000aSo yea, thanks a ton for the advice. I will absolutely use it. I'm expecting a call back tomorrow from a "services manager" because retentions got sick of me and told me there was nothing they could do. Apparently I wasn't enough of an asshole to get direct results.\u000a\u000aI spoke to a T-Mobile rep today and he quoted me about half what I'm paying Sprint through their business plans using my IRS tax ID. I've pretty much decided I'm going to switch over. I'd really like to stick with Sprint but after this experience I'm not sure what they could possibly do to convince me to stay besides immediately getting their towers in order or rolling out 4G LTE in my area plus comping my bill by half. The only thing I'll be losing is unlimited 3G, but T-Mobile also has unlimited, it's just metered a bit after you hit your cap meaning I'll still have reliable card processing no matter what.

VReturn it. Not because it's a bad tablet, it's actually very good and it sounds like yours has a defect (my first one did too and replacing it was a breeze).\u000a\u000aThe reason I say to return it is because everyone else here is right. There's no reason to get a Nook Color when the Nexus 7 is on the market. It's better in absolutely every way.\u000a\u000aThe Nook Color and the Nook Tablet both came out a decent while before the N7. The price points have not caught up. The Nexus 7 from Google is meant to drive down costs on comparable and lower end tablets to make higher competition in the Android tablet market. The next wave of reader-centric tablets we see will be at a lower price point. If this is what you're going for, return it and wait for the next Kindle or Nook release. If not, get a Nexus 7.

It's not getting or even monetising the information that's evil. It's where it ends up.\u000a\u000aWhen you give Facebook your information you're giving it to Facebook to sell off, as well as exposing it to a host of shady-as-fuck apps that run through Facebook.

Google doesn't make money by selling your info off to shady advertising companies. Google is both the data collector and the advertising company. When people give money to Google for targeted advertising, they're not buying any data. They're simply paying Google to run some advertisements using their internal metrics. If Google were to sell off your data they'd be offloading their primary commodity to direct competitors. Doesn't sound like sound business strategy does it?\u000a\u000aTargeted advertising and personal information gathering is not inherently evil. If you insist on using Facebook and other web sites that engage in questionable privacy practices while there are companies out there who are trying to play the game within ethical confines you have nobody to blame but yourself when you get outraged about shit like this.

V&gt;In the debate on whether to allow charter schools, one argument in particular always seems to surface from the pro-charter crowd: charters provide parents choice! It\u2019s a common refrain. It\u2019s also a lie. To see why, consider the following passage from this morning\u2019s News Tribune:\u000a\u000a&gt;\u201c\u2019A charter school does not equal an innovative school,\u2019 says [Jennifer] Boutell, statewide field director for People for Our Public Schools, a group working to defeat the initiative. \u2018A charter school is not a curriculum. A charter school is not a particular teaching method, or even an extended school day. A charter school is an ownership model.\u2019\u201d \u000a\u000aThose two paragraphs have nothing to do with one another despite the words "To see why..." followed by a quote.

VUhg, I know this thread has exploded and this will get buried, but this one sucks so I'll share it anyway in hopes someone is bored and browses all the way down...\u000a\u000aI worked in a Navy Exchange store. It's the chain of retail stores on Navy bases around the world. Like a Sears with no tax and lower paid employees.\u000a\u000aWell the grocery counterpart to the Exchange is the Commissary. The Commissary doesn't pay their grocery baggers. They work completely on tips. They aren't just baggers though, they take your groceries out to your car for you, which is the justification for the tips.\u000a\u000aThese tip-based bagger positions are largely filled by young, strong, high school age military brats looking to make some coin in their free time. Just the kind of thing you'd expect from a simple, low paying, extremely flexible and physically demanding job in a small community with a lot of bored kids.\u000a\u000aBut for some reason there was an unusually high amount of very (very) old people working these positions. When I first started working at the Exchange and noticed fit, young sailors having 90 year old men and women hunched over the cart carrying out their groceries I was disgusted. I mentioned it to my co-worker and she corrected me that they work on tips and if they don't carry out groceries they don't get paid. It was expected that whoever bagged your groceries carried them out to your car and they'd get an appropriate tip. It was considered disrespectful not to do it.\u000a\u000aIt turned out they were primarily immigrants or parents and grandparents of immigrants that either joined the military or married someone in the military. They were predominantly (completely) Asian and living with their children on the base. They didn't need the money, it wasn't really a living wage. Like I said, more like summer job work for high school kids. I guess they just wanted to work and feel useful.

VI used to play Rainbow Six ladders back in the 90's and early 00's. On occasion I'd have my team all run an aimbot on a separate instance of the game on a locked private server so we'd know what to watch out for in tournament games. We'd take turns with one team aimbotting and one team legit.\u000a\u000aYou're absolutely right. With a bit of common sense you can break heuristic detection easily. The most common form of detection is unrealistic accuracy levels over time. It's a stupidly easy fix, just pop off a mag or two into the air now and then in a battle to keep your accuracy levels at an inconspicuous level. Don't use weapons with splash damage, take a the occasional dive, pump a few rounds into a team mate every hour or so, etc.\u000a\u000aIt gets pretty easy to spot once you have a trained eye for it, but a computer wouldn't be able to detect it if the player was careful.

VPeople need to stop thinking of a Halo movie as a movie based on a game. That whole idea spawns visions of Ewe Bol, the decline of the Resident Evil series, and the short-lived novelty of movies like Doom.\u000a\u000aIf people want to take the idea of a Halo movie seriously it needs to be viewed from the perspective of any other sci-fi franchise that's spawned a movie. The whole idea needs to be removed from the idea of the video games completely.\u000a\u000aThat's what makes this series so great. If you'd only played a couple Halo games you might not even realize this series was set in the Halo universe until the third episode. It's taken elements of the story that are only known by fans of the books and integrated them into a well rounded and engaging story that isn't all about "LOL ANYONE REMEMBER THIS FROM THE GAME?!!?"\u000a\u000aFor a franchise based on a FPS, the Halo universe has an extremely deep and rich lore. It's told in extreme detail from several different perspectives with several overlapping story arcs. That's where the true substance of the universe lies and that's what needs to be sampled to make a good movie.\u000a\u000aIf a studio could truly embrace this aspect and market it appropriately to sci-fi fans instead of Halo fans or gamers as whole the cost wouldn't be as much of an issue.

You're putting words in my mouth. In fact, you saying "not quite accurate" is completely disingenuous as nothing I said has any relevance to the points you made. \u000a\u000a&gt;The GCN architecture on the newer cards is what allows for software optimizations that the older and more rigid architecture does not allow for. This is not planned obsolescence, it's progress in technology.\u000a\u000aThat does not negate the possibility of patches which still support cards which run modern games perfectly well.\u000a\u000aYou can actually hack the newer drivers to work with the legacy cards. There is no fundamental change in the architecture which prevents these cards from running the latest version of Catalyst. You're just pulling things out of thin air with no practical understanding of what it is I'm talking about.\u000a\u000aBut all of that is completely irrelevant. What it comes down to is that one company is going out of their way to keep support for their legacy cards going with software patches. Another isn't. I have a choice between them.

VI bought the 4870HD in mid 2010 when it was named the best value card in the sub $250 bracket by Tom's. Back then it could play any game at fairly high graphics settings. Right now I can play any current games on at least medium graphics settings. The card is still current in terms of power and is perfectly respectable. Pulling driver updates out from under the rug like this for a card that still has the power to hang with modern graphics is fucking bullshit. It's engineered obsolescence.\u000a\u000aTo put things in perspective, the card I replaced with the 4870 was an Nvidia 7600GT, released in 2006. And holy shit, if we go to the Nvidia drivers page, the current supported version for the 7600GT is the current stable Nvidia driver for their modern cards!\u000a\u000aThis is laziness or blatant money grabbing. It's no different than a printer company artificially expiring ink cartridges that are perfectly fine under the bullshit guise of keeping the printer healthy. I don't upgrade when the manufacturer tells me it's time to upgrade. I upgrade when I need an upgrade.\u000a\u000aThere are two main choices in GPUs. From where I'm sitting, Nvidia sounds like a safer bet if they're going to keep their legacy cards up to date with driver patches.

It just came to me a few days ago when I was about to boil some beef back rib bones for some broth that I had a pile of stripped corn cobs from grilled corn. I've heard of people using corn cobs in various recipes to add flavor so I figured I'd check google for any caveats of boiling corn cobs.\u000a\u000aIt looked like a common thing so I threw them in my broth and they surprisingly overpowered my beef flavor. The overpowering flavor was due to the small amount of bone and method of cooking though.\u000a\u000aI used it in a ~6 hour beef stew the next day mixed about 1.5:1 corn:beef broth with some ultra-concentrated beef broth I'd had in the freezer from a batch of braised short ribs. It turned out to be the most flavorful stew I'd ever tasted. I added almost zero seasoning just to give it a fair shot and added generic beef cubes, leeks, potatoes, carrots garlic and onion. Very basic stew ingredients. The corn definitely made the stew better in terms of flavor and starchy texture.\u000a\u000a**I highly recommend it. Here's a bit of a tl:dr recipe to follow to get the same results I did:**\u000a\u000aMake some braised beef short ribs:\u000a\u000aBraise a pot of beef short ribs in tomato sauce. Take a clay or cast iron pot or slow cooker and pour a bit of tomato sauce in the bottom, fill with short ribs and cover with tomato sauce. Braise for ~4 hours.\u000a\u000aRemove the meat from the bones and use it for something like tacos or chili. Don't waste this for your stew, use it on something now.\u000a\u000aSave whatever liquid is left from the braise. There shouldn't be much thick matter left, most of the tomato thickness should have been absorbed by the fibers of the beef. Pour the fat and suet from the braise, along with the beef bones into a pot and simmer for ~8 hours, adding water as needed.\u000a\u000aTake two grilled corn cobs and quarter them. You can grill them and cut the corn off to eat alone or use in other recipes or you can just eat it off and toss it in. Simmer the corn for about 8 hours as well, adding water as needed. Make sure the corn water is well salted to help break down fibers in the corn to promote water transfer.\u000a\u000aMix the two broths together depending on your tastes. Add all the veggies you like. Leeks are awesome, onions and potatoes are vital, garlic is sexy, bay leaves are ubiquitous. Sear some cubes of beef over the highest heat you can possibly get using your stove or grill and throw it all together.\u000a\u000aSimmer for about five hours.

VHow has nobody mentioned corn cobs yet?\u000a\u000aCorn cobs and beef bones make some amazing broth that will give you some unmatchable stew. Beef bones give you the traditional broth flavor and a couple of roasted and quatered corn cobs will give you a very strong and fantastic corn flavor, as well as some added starch to thicken up your stew.

VWhile I don't disagree, I think the bigger picture paints a more practical picture of the changes. To see that picture we have to take another step back.\u000a\u000aBad Co 2 was a pretty decent game and all of your points are spot-on. But what you're missing is that BF3 is to BC2 as BC2 is to BF2. The transition from BC2 to BF3 was only a continued natural de-evolution of the Battlefield franchise. It's not as if Bad Co 2 was this original and new complex shooter that had broken ground into the large-scale FPS combat model. In fact, Bad Co 2 was a serious step backward in mechanics for most BF1942, BF2 and (to a lesser extent) BF2142 vets.\u000a\u000aBF3 should not have been a successor to BC2. BC2 should have remained a spinoff, an entity in the franchise all its own designed to promote console compatibility (which it did a great job of IMO). BF3 should have been a successor to BF2, staying true to the original mechanics of the Battlefield franchise in all its expansive and highly technical glory. Instead it was further dumbed down and prettified to cater to the lowest common denominator. I'm not saying that's always a bad thing in gaming, but in the context of the Battlefield franchise they've forsaken what made them so popular in the first place. As a hardcore Battlefield fan I can't help but feel a bit betrayed by the things done to the franchise between BF2 and BF3.

VI think a better explanation of my point would be:\u000a\u000aThe Covenant, even in really tough situations (maybe save for your first Hunter encounter) always felt like, "Yea, I can get out of this if I just figure out the right buttons to press and when".\u000a\u000aThe flood had moments where I felt more like, "Holy shit I'm not going to make it out of this if I stick around. Time to just fucking run."\u000a\u000aLike I said, the Covenant felt like puzzles, the Flood felt like terror. In CE the Covenant war might as well have been going on for a hundred years. You have no real practical concept of your relationship with the Covenant. Everything is about the mystery surrounding the Forerunners and the Flood.\u000a\u000aIn the books you have an actual concept of the mystery and quiet fear of the Covenant as the enemy who is not only winning, but completely decimating the human species in every encounter. Whispers of their encounters are suppressed by the UNSC to keep up morale, but humans in all corners of controlled space are hearing the whispered rumors of the aliens which can not be defeated, just waiting and hoping that they're not next on the list of systems to find out first hand what people mean by "glassed".\u000a\u000aEven the Grunts in the books have a sense of fear instilled counter to the stupid comic relief they offer in CE. The Grunts, while disposable, attack in waves of hundreds, like Japanese kamikaze pilots, ruthlessly burying their enemies in corpses to wear them down for the cavalry of Elite super soldiers to come in and sweep up the survivors.

Several times he raised his voice over the moderator to rebut something Obama said after his time was up, and there was the one glaring time when he actually took time away from his following question which he got first word on to rebut Obama while the person who asked the question was just standing there waiting for him to pretend he gave a fuck about it.\u000a\u000aIt came off as extremely immature and slighted that he couldn't accept that the last word wasn't his on every topic.

You'll need at the very least a good digital thermometer at grill level on the firebox side of your meat and the exhaust side.

I like the versatility and size of offsets so I'm going to design my own with some built in thermocouple probes with external ports and/or displays for temperature reading. I'm going to modify the bottom with a rack of firebricks to normalize temperature while maintaining lots of smoke. I'm going to put a below-grill exhaust and some extremely bulky baffles with a full high temperature gasket seal.

VI absolutely disagree. By saying "hot enough" you're making it sound like the pan must be very hot. For scrambled eggs on cast iron a med-low heat will give you much better eggs which will not stick at all. You just have to keep the eggs moving. Cast iron transfers heat to food very efficiently and eggs are delicate. Eggs are not steak. Keep the heat down. If your eggs stick to your cast iron at low heat, your pan is not properly seasoned.

VYou left out a very important point that is one of the most common vectors of doxing.\u000a\u000a**DO NOT USE THE SAME EMAIL ADDRESS FOR SOCIAL NETWORKS AND FORUMS AS YOU USE FOR OTHER COMMUNICATION METHODS!**\u000a\u000aSo you reply *"But HittingSmoke! He said to make all of your social networks private so that covers your email exposing your profiles!"*. **Wrong** (sort of).\u000a\u000aIf someone gets their hands on your email, by default settings on most social networks they can just punch it into a search engine to locate your profile. Even if say on Facebook, all of your information is private, by default you can still be searched. Just getting a hit on an email address search for a social network will net them your real first and name, at the very least.\u000a\u000a*"But HittingSmoke, I make myself unsearchable in my Facebook privacy settings!"* Well, how many times has that setting or a similar privacy setting been reset on Facebook in the interest of "user experience"? A person only needs to get your personal information once. It's not like they need to maintain access to it to utilize it. Also, whether you're searchable or not, many social networks have a fatal flaw in this security measure. You can still import address books from other services. So you're not searchable, someone adds your email address to their Gmail contacts, has Facebook import them, and they'll see who got pending friend requests whether they're searchable or not. Yea... you're totally searchable.\u000a\u000aThis doesn't even take into account personal information indexing sites. You may not have known about them, but they absolutely exist. Some of them are quite thorough and save a database of your social networking profiles attached to your name, phone number, address and social network/email links. A day of being searchable on Facebook is a potential lifetime of vulnerability.\u000a\u000aSo the most basic option is to make a dummy email account to use as your social network logins. Treat this like your password. Make it private immediately. Keep it private and never use it for communication purposes.\u000a\u000aA more fun but not as fool-proof method is to use email operators. A lot of people don't know this, but your email is not static, meaning it does not have to be entered as-is to get your email delivered to you. For email servers that support proper standards you can put a + sign after the personal identifier part of your email then put fucking anything you want after it and your email will still get to you.\u000a\u000aFor example: If your email address is MyEmail@email.com, when signing up for Facebook you could enter your address as MyEmail+Facebooklogin@email.com. Of course that's easily guessable if someone has your real email address, so something a little more practical would be a randoms string like MyEmail+78dfj34@Email.com. Only ever use that email address for Facebook logins, keep it private in your profile and no one will ever be able to search for your profile on Facebook.\u000a\u000aThis isn't completely fool proof as you're still putting your trust in the holder to keep your email stored in the state in which you entered it. It would be quite simple for Facebook or any other service provider to strip the extra information added to your email address using a regular expression. You'll also run into a lot of sites run by completely fucking incompetent web developers who think it's a good idea to use regex validation on emails. Nobody in the history of web development has ever done a good job of this so if you encounter a web site that says "please enter a valid email address" when you use a +, I'd encourage you to politely email the webmaster and send them a link to the wikipedia page on email address standards.\u000a\u000aI use a combination of the two. My general email address has two other personal level email addresses connected to it so I can send and receive email for all of my accounts through one login. I use various strings to let me filter email by incoming email address and it also gives my email-based logins a layer of obfuscation from my actual email address.\u000a\u000aYou can also use a . anywhere in an email address from a provider that supports standards and it won't break email delivery as well. M.yEmail@email.com, My.Email@email.com and MyEm.ail@email.com are all valid addresses that will resolve to the same account.\u000a\u000aThese are not absolutes as everyone knows that there are companies who give no fucks about web standards. If you use Gmail these options will be available to you.

That's like calling me a rapist because I find someone attractive and would like to have sex with them, even if I don't ever look at or speak to them for the rest of my life.\u000a\u000aSince one of your mental illnesses seems to affect your reading comprehensions and communication skills, I'll elaborate on my original point in enough detail that you can't continue intentionally misinterpreting me to satisfy your own need to attack people.\u000a\u000a&gt;Tell us all about how it's not fair that men who enjoy diddling or the thought of diddling little kids get mocked relentlessly by SRSters on reddit.\u000a\u000aSo my original point brought up the issue of gay being a choice vs being genetic. This asshole said specifically that it's fair for them to relentless mock men who are attracted to *the thought* of sex with children.\u000a\u000aNow, if we've conceded that being gay is not a choice then we've conceded that you're not in control of who or what you're attracted to sexually. If you subscribe to this (correct) school of thought, then pedophiles have no control over their attraction to children. They do not choose to be attracted to someone who can't consent to sex. There is nothing inherently evil about a pedophile.\u000a\u000aI think we can now agree that pedophiles aren't born because an otherwise normal and healthy person wakes up one day, dons a top hat a monacle, and says to themselves, "You know what I'd like to start doing today? Raping children! Yea... fucking children sounds just grand!" I would say that being sexually attracted to children is not conducive to good health for the pedophile or potentially the people around him. That makes it by definition an illness.\u000a\u000aAnd now that we've established all of that, we come full circle back to where /u/Kleus said that s/he believes that it's OK to mock the mentally ill for what's going on inside their minds even if they don't act those urges out on other people, then where you, /u/smallkahunaburger, said that anyone who talks about pedophelia from a scientific approach is automatically a pedophile.\u000a\u000aNow if you've adopted any other SRS habits outside of making false and unfounded accusations about people who disagree with you, I'm sure you've also already plugged your ears and gotten ready to start yelling "LOL DIDN'T READ WORDSWORDSWORDS" similar to what a four year old does when he's told it's bed time. So to tl;dr that for you:\u000a\u000aDay dreaming about slitting someone's throat in the supermarket for taking up the whole isle while having a conversation is not the same as walking up to someone with a knife and slitting their throat.\u000a\u000aYou then went on to:\u000a\u000a* State all pedophiles are rapists\u000a* Accuse me of jumping to conclusions by arguing against points I never made\u000a* Accuse me of being a pedophile for saying that not all pedophiles rape children\u000a* Try to redefine the word "sex" to only apply to consensual activity\u000a* Reference two directly contradictory "statistics" while you never cited any sources\u000a* Reference statistics which do not exist because they can not be scientifically measured\u000a* Try to redefine the word "molester" to mean people who've never molested anyone\u000a\u000aI hope I was detailed enough in that recap that you can't continue to mischaracterize what I've said and accuse me of pedophhilia. I'm sure you'll try very hard to find a way though, because that's a lot easier than arguing with evidence, facts and reality.

I can be both because the lack of substantial claims is precisely what makes it a hit piece in the fucking first place.\u000a\u000aLet's break it down one at a time, shall we?\u000a\u000a&gt;That's what Mitt Romney has done, according to his 2010 and 2011 tax returns, a trove of secret Bain Capital documents unearthed by Gawker\u000a\u000aWhoa, first red flag right there. Unearthed by Gawker? Gawker is about as credible as news about Obama broken by Fox News or new about Romney broken by /r/politics. There are no sources cited, and if Gawker and Vanity Fair are among the best they can come up with without even providing links, I'm not fucking impressed.\u000a\u000a&gt;Are Romney's tax dodges legal? **It's impossible to say for sure**, given how little he has disclosed.\u000a\u000a&gt;"He aggressively exploits every loophole he can find," says Victor Fleischer, a professor of tax law at the University of Colorado.\u000a\u000a**This source fails to cite any actual evidence from the man who's quoted**\u000a\u000a&gt;Did he reveal his secret account to avoid prosecution for tax evasion? "He's not quite denied that," says Daniel Shaviro, a professor of tax law at NYU.\u000a\u000a**Have you denied raping and murdering a young girl in 1990?**\u000a\u000a&gt;Yet he failed to report its existence on any financial disclosures prior to his 2010 tax return, even though it is under his control. "What is this corporation? What does it do? Why was it set up in a tax haven?" asks Wilkins. "There's a reason why it's in Bermuda."\u000a\u000a**1. Sooooource? I thought we didn't have anything pre-2010? 2. Specufuckinglation!**\u000a\u000a&gt;Has Romney paid all his taxes on the shady funds? **Only he and the IRS know for sure.** But even if Romney never cheated personally, the feeder funds he appears to have invested in cater to tax criminals, making it easier for him and his Bain partners to raise capital and rake in big management fees. \u000a\u000a**I don't know, did Glenn Beck really rape and murder a young girl in 1990? Glenn Beck surely hasn't denied raping and murdering a young girl back in 1990**\u000a\u000aThere are some facts to be learned here. Some about flaws in the tax code, some about Romney and Bain. If you want to write an article shining light on facts, you don't fill it with a bunch of admittedly speculative, poorly sourced and uncited bullshit bias opinions. This is obviously an extremely biased hit piece that was written from inception to bash Romney no matter what the findings were. If it were an objective and moderate piece about serious and factual issues then there wouldn't be so much "Did Romney break the law? We don't know, but he totally could have!"

VThe real point to take home here is a crush injury vs a severing injury. Most people don't realize how big of a difference there really is.\u000a\u000aA crush injury is extremely traumatic on your nervous system. Even getting a finger smashed can send you into severe shock making you light headed and cause you to throw up or pass out. I got a couple fingers smashed in a several ton concrete dock once in a way that would have sheared the meat right off my bones had I not been wearing gloves. Even with the protection of gloves I almost puked in the car on the way to the hospital.\u000a\u000aGetting something cut or broken clean off is an entirely different kind of injury that has a very different impact on your body and mind. Getting your toes cut off by a bending steel toe would be far better than getting them crushed under equal force. I'll take a guillotine on any of my extremities before I ever suffer another crush injury. That shit is no joke.

VI think it's because Google became so quietly ubiquitous in so many areas over a fairly short period of time. Personally I give no fucks. I'll be the first to admit that I'm a Google fanboy.\u000a\u000aIt seems like Google just popped up out of nowhere one day and the next week it was the search engine everyone was using. Likewise with Gmail. It went into beta and a large handfull of geeks were using it, then a month later fucking everybody was using Gmail. Remember when Mapquest was a verb like Xerox? When was the last time someone asked to you Mapquest something for them? It dropped off the face of the planet over the course of a few short months as Google Maps took over. \u000a\u000aAnd that was all only a few short years ago. Now Android phones are everywhere. Google has a TV service. They have music and video rentals and sales. A powerful online office suite with reliable cloud storage. They handle our voicemail. We host our web apps on App Engine. Every small business is on Google Places. I'd argue that Google+ is the only successful Google service that didn't just explode into the mainstream, but it's one of the few areas they've branched into where there was already a 900 pound gorilla that was popular with more than just the tech geeks.\u000a\u000aIt wouldn't surprise me if there are a lot of people out there that feel like Google just stormed in and took over leaving a psychological imprint of an evil empire. The fact of the matter is, the areas where Google has been extremely successful are areas where the competition they faced going in was stagnant or lackluster at best. Google has *stayed* on top because instead of just pulling ahead of their shitty competition to be "good enough" they've busted ass to make the best products they possibly could before their competition had a chance to turn their heads and see what the fuck was coming at them.\u000a\u000aSo yea, I don't hate on Google even when the ~~tech news sites~~ basement bloggers try to stir up controversy to generate traffic. I understand Google's business model. I understand it because I'm a business owner who pays Google to advertise for me. I know exactly how they use the data they collect because I capitalize on it myself and I'm perfectly happy providing it to them in exchange for their wicked awesome services.

V&gt;Also, if you know what it is, you should also know that it is setup that way by an administrator or webmaster, not a developer. I'm sure the basic definition of roles must have been covered somewhere in your extensive experience.\u000a\u000aWhen executing a web app like a forum or a CMS you're generally expected to have some web design principles under your belt so you don't mangle the user experience or template. This is why many people who don't know these things pay others to configure their web apps for them, after which the administrators maintain more of a moderator position than anything.\u000a\u000a&gt;How I choose to use a tool is up to me, not the person who made it or the others who use it. If I want to use a shoe as a hammer, that is my prerogative, saying "You're doing it wrong" just makes you look like an ass.\u000a\u000aThat's complete and utter bullshit. For one, the analogy is once again horrible as your using a shoe as a hammer doesn't affect the user experience of those who are using your product unless you're doing a shitty job nailing together your product in which case people saying "You're doing it wrong" is completely sound and constructive advice which you should heed.\u000a\u000aIf you don't have a problem with it, then fine.

V&gt;I'm not lecturing anyone. I don't claim to be the most perfect writer in all of history. Your attacking a website with no knowledge of what the website is or does. I am simply providing the information you should have before making judgments.\u000aYou don't go judging a country from a single picture of one of its population, You don't judge a Sporting team by one play they make, yet you think its OK to Judge a community based on a screenshot from their registration page.\u000a\u000aThat analogy is... not an analogy at all. This is not a country, this is not a sports team. This is a web site that someone built.\u000a\u000aIf an electrician wires up a house and does a terrible fucking job on a single outlet, that is not a good electrician and that electrician did not do a good job on that house. If a painter paints over the siding while painting the trim of a single window and leaves it, that is not a good paint job. A single bad element on a web page is indeed completely fair game to be labeled piss poor web design. THAT is how you make an analogy to something that is built... Countries? WTF? Really?\u000a\u000a&gt;I say once more, that the RANDOM QUESTION (meaning multiple questions that randomly appear with each refresh of the page) is not meant to be used as a means of determining Bots from Humans, There is a CAPTCHA question above it for that purpose.\u000a\u000a&gt;In this instance, the question is meant to limit the memberships to people who will fit in with the other members. It is not elitist, It is not discriminatory, it is simple method of choosing ones friends based on shared interests.\u000a\u000aWhether you want it to be CAPTCHA or not, it fucking is. That's not a debatable opinion. That is a fact. There was absolutely no indication from your screenshot that this wasn't intended to be used as CAPTCHA. Every indication points to this being part of a two-step CAPTCHA system. I'm still not convinced it isn't since you don't seem to understand the basic tenets of web design or development so you're obviously not on the development team for the site. You seem to just be pulling this claim of filtering out non-Firefly fans out of nowhere.\u000a\u000a&gt;If you visit the site (which by the way is mentioned and linked to in one of the comments) you would quickly see right on the homepage what the website is about. If you have no interest in the topic/project, its unlikely you would proceed to register, but under the circumstances that you do want to this question, in the very least, makes sure you have the kind of attitude that would be welcome within the community.\u000a\u000aPlease tell me how knowing a piece of trivia is at all a reflection on my attitude?\u000a\u000a&gt;Again, I don't make any claim that I have perfect Grammar, My reference is to the fact that it is a name, which means it is has capital letter.\u000a\u000aProper nouns are capitalized. Browncoat is not a proper noun so I'm not sure exactly what you're talking about in the context of capitalization. My point actually had nothing to do with capitalization, though (if your CAPTCHA is case-sensitive, you're also a fucking terrible web developer/designer). It has to do with browncoats being not phonetically discernable as being one or two words. That's something nobody could possibly know just by virtue of having seen and being a fan of Firefly. It is **bad design.**

Yes, they EVOLVED into an amazingly talented musical group, but those early records were boy-band/pop.  Get over it.  I mean hell, did it ever occur to you One Direction is paying tribute to the beatles here?  Probably not, because I'm sure you're the ONLY people that can like the Beatles, right?  But then you shit yourselves when you find out some younger kids don't know who the Beatles are.  You treat it like a "damned if you do, damned if you don't" situation.

VUhh taking things slow to try to get to know someone without dealing with a one-on-one situation isn't being a bitch.  It's like in highschool, when you get set up with a date for a prom.  Whoever set you up may make a group arrangement so you can get to know your date prior to having to spend an entire night with them, alone at some points.  That's all the article was saying, but reddit saw the word "friendzoned" and got the whole "if she doesn't want to sleep with me after I say 'hi' then she's a cuntwhorebagbitchface" mentality.

You're afraid that if this riot gets out of hand it can turn into chaos and destruction much like the riots in London, so you're putting your life potentially at risk to prevent that?  Man, you're just out to ruin my opportunity to fuck with other people's lives man.  That asshole who works 2 full time jobs to support his family doesn't need his car!  How dare you not let me set it on fire!"  Breaking up riots comes as a potential part of the job - that doesn't mean he deserves to be hurt as a result.  There mere fact that he's getting attacked shows that the riot is somewhat violent, and he's out there trying to quell it so little boys like you can sleep easy at night.  \u000a\u000aAnd really?  You're going to make fun of careers that don't require a high school education?  There's a good amount of jobs out there that don't, yet some that are necessary for survival.

VI turned 15 my sophomore year and that's when I started.  HOWEVER, I never once thought it was my birth-right nor felt entitled that it was something that I had to be allowed to do with no questions asked.  That's when it becomes a problem.  But I definitely see where you're coming from in my older state, and 15 is where I'd draw the line for sure, and even then it's questionable (but I TRY not to be hypocritical if I can help it, you know?).

VWhy would you bet on the latter?  Not all cops are out to ruin your pretty little world; in fact most aren't.  They have a duty to their job, and if their boss tells them "go control these riots", you can bet that's what they're gonna do.  Some cops use more extreme means than others, but again, that's a minority.  They have their bosses, just like you have yours I'm sure.  If you're boss assigns you a project, it becomes you're duty to fulfill it.  Not a hard concept to grasp.  So before you go and start making assumptions about this individual cop's life, try to empathize.  He may have a family to feed, he's fortunate enough to have a job.  A job means a source of income, which means he can buy food, which means he can feed his family.  See?  He may have a duty, and he's doing what he can to fulfill it.  We call this responsibility; we call this being grown up.

VUpvote for a good case.  Those are all unfortunate cases of intolerance, but that's what I'm trying to work against.  The atheist knows her 4 year old's cancer is obviously one of the most unfortunate things in the world, but she also knows that God has nothing to do with it.  So as hard as it may be to hear something so hurtful about you and your child, you know the truth so I mean as hard as it is just sit their and take it.  If a hospital denied you for being an atheist, that's a real issue that would take much deeper thinking.  \u000a\u000aFurthermore, I'm not trying to say that this can happen overnight or anything and, to quote Batman, "the night is always darkest before the dawn".  So that kid that got kicked out?  Hopefully he'll realize he got kicked out because of intolerance, and although his case is shitty as fuck and unfortunate, in the future he'll do his damn best to be not so bigoted.  And of course I intend for tolerance by people of faith too, that's the whole point.  So the Catholic denial is absolutely absurd and obviously shouldn't be legal.  I'm not gonna go much further with this because this topic in itself can be written about in length, but basically I'm just saying that if we currently gain a good grounding in tolerance, then if all works out well, in the future there will be significantly less intolerance and the above circumstances won't have to be heard of.

VTolerance doesn't mean you believe any aspect of them.  Tolerance isn't asking you to accept any of the ideologies presented in a particular belief.  "Tolerance - a fair, objective, and permissive attitude toward those whose opinions, practices, race, religion, nationality, etc., differ from one's own; freedom from bigotry. "\u000a\u000aYou can think its absurd, so hold that to your own self and just let it be.  Simple as that.

VIf what defines "you" is your consciousness, and if that is dependent on your body, then what happens if your stream of consciousness is interrupted? If your brain shuts down, go into a coma, or gets knocked unconscious, does that mean that the person who wakes up from that is not you? Yeah they would know all the things before their consciousness stopped, and they would think they are the same person, and even act exactly like the same person, but did whoever went into unconsciousness ever wake up.\u000a\u000aHere's a thought experiment to illustrate: Imagine an exact clone of you is made as you are right now, down to the very nerve impulses in your brain. That person would know, think, and act the exactly the same as you do. But that person is not you, "you" are you. Now what if you are killed without either of you meeting each other. No one would know that person is not you, not even him. That's what I'm afraid loosing your stream consciousness might be like. \u000a\u000aI started thinking about this after reading [this](http://www.cracked.com/article_15655_5-awesome-sci-fi-inventions-that-would-actually-suck_p2.html) Cracked.com article about a major flaw in sci-fi teleporters.

VEasiest way to pick up a foreign language is to first get a basic understanding of it through some lessons, and then pretty much surround yourself with it. Best way to do this is to move to someplace where it's the main language, but books and movies can also help.

VThanks, I have to give credit to the movie Contact for that last part about poetry though. Still, its the thought that counts, at least it's the only thing that counts down here. Our thoughts are all we have left. I understand now, It's all anyone has ever had, even back on the surface. I can't believe we had to come down here to figure that out.

VAnd then 66xsseldoG knew, God_of_Abraham was that somebody. His was the face that 66xsseldoG kept seeing through the night. Hovering before his eyes...with blood... slowly flowing over those glasses. \u000a\u000a66xsseldoG could take it no more. He picked up a small wood carving knife, opened the door, and stepped out into the cold night. As he walked through the cobblestone streets, trembling, he thought about what he was going to do.

VI would say the time it takes to prepare a skill should be compensated, otherwise a doctor's time would be even less than a janitors. The argument behind why there would still be doctors is that doctors will say that society needs them, and that they are naturally better at being doctors than janitors and so take that position. But why would they spend 10,000 hours becoming an awesome doctor when you can spend 10 hours becoming a half-assed janitor and earn as much a lot sooner. Its an interesting idea but i don't think it'll be a better place than where we are now.

VIts the same for any group, but just an example "please take a moment of silence and pray for those that died during this dreadful day." Obnoxious kid "EXCUSE ME IM ATHEIST!" Again just an example not true for all atheists. \u000a\u000aBut my point is the generally obnoxious people of a group seems to set the stereotype for the rest, etc muslims = terrorist, atheists are insensitive, vegans are obnoxious.\u000aIt may not be true but that's how allot of people see it.

VWell aren't you the hilarious troll who probablly doesn't even know what half the words he wrote even mean. So i will inform you:\u000a\u000a1. Allah akbar means god is great\u000a\u000a2. jihad means war to defend innocent people, not suicide on innocent people because they are of different beliefs, god only asks to spread the word of islam peacefully and by no means force them to become muslim, the fact that you offered to tell them is enough and there is no such thing as killing for islam because killing someone is a sin unless you are defending against a physical attacker.\u000a\u000a3. "Durka Durka" Is not a real arabic word, it is just a word someone made up to insult muslims or arabs and is frankly pretty stupid.\u000a\u000a4. Muhammad (peace be upon him) was the last prophet of the of islam and the messenger of god, when someone is becomign muslim they usually say in arabic "I swear that there is no other god but god and Mohammed is his messenger"\u000a\u000aI hope i informed you, i did not come here to talk religion but if your gonna come throw blatant insults i will just correct and inform you because thats what muslims are really about and thats what the qurans about. if you would like to know more ask me and i will tell you more.

VWas in /r/islam and i found a recent post about disposing of a quran\u000a\u000a\u000aAs far as old and unusable copies of the Qur\u2019an are concerned, it is not permitted to burn them unless there is no other way to dispose of them.\u000a\u000aThe Hanafi scholar, Imam Ibn Abidin states:\u000aIf a copy of the Qur'an becomes old and it is difficult to read from it, it should not be burnt in fire. This is what Imam Muhammad (m: student of Imam Abu Hanifa) pointed out and this is what we take. It will not be disliked to bury it. It should be wrapped in a pure cloth, and a Lahd grave (m: grave that has a incision in the side wall, customary in hot climate countries where the earth is solid) should be dug, because if a Shiq grave (m: grave with a straight opening, common in cold climate countries due to the earth being soft) is dug and the copy of the Qur\u2019an is buried, it will entail the soil falling on top of the Qur\u2019an which is a form of disrespect, unless a slab is placed as a roof\u2026 (Radd al-Muhtar, 5/271)\u000a\u000aIn light of the above, there are two methods of disposing of an unusable copy of the Qur\u2019an:\u000aWrapping it in a pure piece of cloth and burying it respectfully in a place where people (normally) do not walk about. In cold climate countries (such as the UK), one may dig a Shiq grave, but a slab should be placed first and over it the soil.\u000aFastening the Qur\u2019an with a heavy object like a stone and then placing it respectfully in flowing water.\u000aIf one is able to implement the above two methods, it would not be permitted to burn the copy of the Qur\u2019an. However, if the above two methods are difficult to carry out, then one may burn the Qur\u2019an and bury or drown the resulting ash.\u000a\u000a[link](http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/z2em0/how_do_we_retire_qurans/)

VI would go as the Huns if it has to be domination. My initial strategy would be to take out as many people as I can as quickly as I can, before my battering rams and horse archers become too over-matched. I would target the closest civs who I knew were fairly peaceful and not expansionist and rush their capital. The reason being that I want a blitzkrieg. I know I could at least take out 2 civs this way, hopefully 3 or 4, but I've never played a diety game on this large a map.\u000a\u000aThe biggest problem is going to come once civs get more cities and larger armies, when I won't be able to avoid fighting their army by quickly rushing their cities. I might take that time and target nearby city states with my army to continue expansion, but mainly I will have to play some defensive and pray that I don't get hit by too many wars. Once my tech has had a little time to catch up, I would start piggybacking off of other wars to eek out some more territory, although I'd still probably be well behind the AI at this point.\u000a\u000aIf I can make it that far, then I can continue to get my tech matched with the AI, while I take out smaller civs, eventually facing with whatever powerful civ has taken the other side of the map at that point.

VPeople throughout history have claimed that humanity will crumble for various reasons, but predicting the downfall of humanity is pessimistic and is unfair to the ingenuity of humans.\u000a\u000aI'm not putting my faith in science fiction. I think we can do this with existing propulsion technologies, or at least with what existing research suggests is possible. We are talking about a long journey to our nearest neighbors, on the order of decades to a couple centuries. This is a difficult problem, but it should not be impossible.\u000a\u000aWith regard to finding a place to go, it is a difficult task. But all we really NEED is a rocky planet that is not too massive and not too close to its sun. Everything else is icing.

I'm not saying we will immediately find a planet as comfortable or suitable as Earth, but we can survive.\u000a\u000aHowever, let's say worst case, we can't find a single planet that is far enough away from its sun and light enough to live on.

Given any time for preparation, we are probably the most hardy animal on the planet, becoming moreso as our technology advances.\u000a\u000aI agree that it's not worth worrying about something 2 billion years in the future, but not because of the average extinction time for mammals.\u000a\u000aIf humanity is still around as flesh and blood in 2 billion years, we will have colonized new star systems in the galaxy and once that happens, it will take the death of our galaxy and the universe to end humanity.

This is even more misleading. The number of retracted papers has increased from 30 per year to 400 per year over the last decade, where the total number of papers published has only increased by 44%. It also shows that of those retractions, 11% were due to fabrication of results.\u000a\u000aThis article is not science. It is pushing an agenda and being purposely dodgy about the facts.

A baby is not old enough to have a true awareness of the world or even a real sense of self. A baby hasn't had time to develop a personality, so I don't think you are really losing a person when it dies.

Until the baby has time to develop, you are not killing a person, you are killing the idea of what that person might one day be.

The biggest draw to Windows is the open system that every program you could ever want will run on it. Everything else is peripheral to that.\u000a\u000aAlso: the biggest consumers of Microsoft software are corporate customers. Companies mostly all have some software that was built in-house. And to block that out would be tantamount to suicide.

VHate to tell you, but Win9 isn't going to change back from metro. Microsoft bet on a consistent experience accross all of their products, and spent years on this. It was a big bet, and Microsoft knows they have to stay the course.\u000a\u000aI've been using it for months now as my work computer and I have to say that it's not as bad as I thought it would be. The best things are better multi-monitor support and the remote desktop app. The worst is Search (compared to Windows 7), and it's only that it is slightly less convenient in some cases.\u000a\u000aIt makes it slightly less convenient when you want to open up the network settings window for instance, because you need to move down into the Settings section. Also, to run cmd as an admin, you need to press start -&gt; cmd, and then click on the run as administrator button at the bottom of the screen. I've found that is slightly slower than on Windows 7 where you right click run as admin.\u000a\u000aYou might not think that is very severe, and that's because it's not.

You greatly improve election outcomes when you allow the possibility to vote for multiple candidates.\u000a\u000aThe most simple to explain is probably approval voting, which is very simple and immediately apparent that it is a superior system. Approval voting allows you to vote for any number of candidates on the ballot who you would approve of, and the candidate with the most votes wins. So simple, and yet so effective in improving the electoral system. I can tell you why it's so effective, but if you think about it for a little while, I think it should be self-evident.

VI'd hardly call this sensationalist. They didn't go and extrapolate that all things reddit are evil, but the facts are pretty unflattering on their own. The admins really do let pretty much anything go, unless it actually poses an immediate threat to the site itself (e.g. jailbait might threaten to get the site shutdown), which means that some areas of reddit become havens for some very shady things.\u000a\u000aThe only thing I've ever seen admins proactively step in on (as opposed to the reactionary closing of jailbait/creepshots) were cases of publishing personal information for the purposes of retribution---a big problem 1-2 years ago.\u000a\u000aWhat is the other side of this?

VI think it's a decent science fiction drama, but it veers away from the "investigate strange happenings" formula somewhere in the second or third season, becomes more plot driven, and never goes back.\u000a\u000aYou're right that there is never really a skeptic in Fringe. There will be a couple episodes where a new character might be skeptical about what's going on, but it never takes long before they accept 100% that everything is batshit crazy. But like I said, the formula of the show changes after the first couple of seasons and it eventually becomes completely plot driven with no formulaic resemblance to X-Files. I think it's worth sticking with if only because it's one of the very few good science fiction shows on television today.\u000a\u000aFringe is more futuristic high tech pseudo-science where X-Files is more of the classic supernatural.

A couple years ago when I was in university and had a lot of free time, I would power through entire seasons of shows only to disappointedly finish them all in less than a week.\u000a\u000aBut then my roommates and I started on X-Files. We would watch at least one episode every night with dinner, and usually more. 6 months later when summer break hit we still had 3 seasons and a couple movies left. I still haven't finished all the seasons, but if you like science fiction, this is the show for you.\u000a\u000aFor the most part it's are kind of like the early seasons of Fringe -- if you are watching that (if not, that's another show I recommend) -- i.e. a serial with detectives investigating the supernatural. There is not really much of an overarching plot until later in the series. Even once a plot gets introduced, most episodes are not at all plot related and strictly science fiction detective serials. And it does that very well.

VYeah, he did. I figured it would be obvious to anyone that he had to have backed it, since he was alive and well back then. I'll quote Wikipedia on the matter:\u000a\u000a&gt;In 1966, Geisel authorized the eminent cartoon artist Chuck Jones \u2013 his friend and former colleague from the war \u2013 to make a cartoon version of How the Grinch Stole Christmas!; Geisel was credited as a co-producer, along with Jones, under his real name, "Ted Geisel." The cartoon, narrated by Boris Karloff, who also provided the voice of the Grinch, was very faithful to the original book, and is considered a classic by many to this day; it is often broadcast as an annual Christmas television special. Jones directed an adaptation of Horton Hears a Who! in 1970, and produced an adaptation of The Cat in the Hat in 1971.\u000a\u000a&gt;From 1972 to 1983, Geisel wrote six animated specials, which were produced by DePatie-Freleng: The Lorax (1972); Dr. Seuss on the Loose (1973); The Hoober-Bloob Highway (1975); Halloween Is Grinch Night (1977); Pontoffel Pock, Where Are You? (1980); and The Grinch Grinches the Cat in the Hat (1982). Several of the specials were nominated for and won multiple Emmy Awards.

VMy reasoning about education was precisely because it is esoteric. Less educated would either just be republican or libertarian.

VI think if you give any random guy a couple of years to practice and learn the NFL and the rules, they could do a decent job of officiating. Of course, no one is doing that 40 hours a week for years, but if they did, I think most people could do alright. You only need somewhat decent eyesight, situational awareness, and mental quickness. However, not anyone could become a Calvin Johnson, no matter how many years they worked at it.\u000a\u000aBut CJ aside, if you look at any NFL roster, half of the team is going to be below $600k. And every single person on every single roster works a hell of a lot harder than any ref. A ref might be working a full 8 hour work day once a week for 20 weeks per year, assuming they do any preparation and review, plus another day of travel time. On the other hand, NFL players work all week long in practice, put their bodies at great risk, and also have to travel. Let's just say that they work 6 days a week though, for the sake of comparison. The refs want to make $10k per day of work, and the median player is making maybe $10k per day of work. I don't think that's fair.

VI say compared to the players, $200k is WAY too much. For example, Cruz only makes $490k. Do you think a ref puts in 40% of the time as him? Or puts his body through 40% as much? Or has 40% of the skill?\u000a\u000aHell no. These are guys that really work maybe 20 weeks a year, 1 day a week, for 3 hours. Okay, maybe they spend time going over tapes or doing setup, but that's at most another 5 hours. So these guys spend 1 real work day per week, with another day tied up in travel. You are talking 200k for 20 days of work.

VI never understood the whole zombie apocalypse thing. Unless there is some sort of event that causes &gt;75% of the population to immediately turn into zombies (classical slow moving zombie herd scenario, not superhuman zombie killing machine scenario), humanity should EASILY win out.\u000a\u000aThe military always somehow seems to get completely overrun and defeated in zombie scenarios, but that seems unlikely. You have extremely well armed and organized people who are also going to be VERY motivated, against herds of unarmed subhumans, whose only real strength is that there are a lot of them.\u000a\u000aSure they can bite you and turn you into a zombie, but it seems like they are just as content to completely devour you. So it seems like the only reliable way to convert anyone as a zombie is to bite them and have them survive, which in most scenarios means the original zombie will have died. Not really going to propagate that way.

VI was semi-successful with a Zoroastrian campaign, without any mods. I think it's doable, but it's fairly difficult. I was able to get independent and take over 8-10 counties. But I eventually ran into trouble with a big Sunni empire, who invaded and destroyed me. But that was partially my fault. I was getting too greedy with invading and taking territory. I'd say that my empire lasted about 60 years as a Zoroastrian state, through 2 different rulers. I don't think it was a holy war against me that resulted in my demise, but a general conquest cassus belli.\u000a\u000aI'm definitely going to try it again though.

V4% sounds small, but it's not. I don't think that everyone does have time for 4%. I do, and you do, but not everyone does. Consider my schedule:\u000a\u000a33% Sleep\u000a\u000a38% Work\u000a\u000a9% Meals\u000a\u000a6% Commute\u000a\u000a4% Hygiene\u000a\u000aSo I have 10% of my day free right now and I have literally no obligations outside of work, so I can throw 4% towards working out. And then I have 6% still to relax, read, watch TV, hang out with friends, do household chores, etc. So I'm fine, but I have no obligations.\u000a\u000aConsider how much having kids adds. Having to make their lunch, having to clean up after them, having to take them to the bus/school. I'd say that spending 10% of your time on family commitments seems like a pretty reasonable estimate.\u000a\u000aSo now I am at 100%, and I've relegated cleaning the house, laundry, and all other tasks to the weekend. Maybe you could offload some of that on your spouse if you have kids, but if you both work (which is the norm these days), you will both probably have similar amounts of time, and either way you're going to be at VERY close to 100%.\u000a\u000aAnd kids aren't the only thing that could put you over the edge. A more demanding or erratic work schedule and a longer commute could probably push you close as well, making it hard to consistently have time.

VIn terms of keeping up with happiness I'd give the following advice (in descending order of priority):\u000a\u000a1. Develop luxury resources!\u000a\u000a2. Trade your excess luxury resources for others' luxury resources. Usually if it's early enough in the game and they don't hate you they will give a 1 for 1 deal. If they don't do a 1 for 1 trade or something reasonably close, then I wouldn't bother. Note that when trading away luxury resources, always make sure that you keep at least 1 of each kind for yourself.\u000a\u000a3. Build happiness buildings.\u000a\u000a4. Build new cities near luxury resources you don't have.\u000a\u000a5. Befriend/ally mercantile city states.\u000a\u000a6. Ally with other city states that have luxury resources that you don't.\u000a\u000a7. Change focus on your cities to avoid growth.\u000a\u000aIn terms of general strategy, this is what I have to offer:\u000a\u000aFor starting research, look around where you are, if you have a ton of bananas and dyes in/near your territory, rush for calendar, if you see deer and ivory, get trapping, if you see copper, get mining. That way when you get your first worker they can immediately start on a resource tile.\u000a\u000aOn that note, always **manually control your workers**!\u000a\u000aYou want to pump out your first few cities pretty quickly unless you are going for a culture victory (which I advise against, it's pretty boring), so my starting build order is usually scout -&gt; monument -&gt; worker (if I'm going down liberty I skip training a worker here and just get the policy) -&gt; settler. Have your scout/warrior explore, autoexplore is usually fine.\u000a\u000aBeyond the initial research, **look at the tech tree**! I usually stay away from the military techs (bottom quarter of the tech tree) until mid-late game, as they don't generally give much beyond improved military units (which you can generally get substitutes for from the middle techs). I look at techs that have or lead to buildings I want/need (like if you are low on happiness, shoot for the easiest tech with a happiness building). And on smaller maps or if I have a tech lead, I go for techs with wonders that I want.\u000a\u000a**Never go to war** unless you absolutely have to or you plan on completely taking out the other civ and know you will win. *"Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win."*\u000a\u000aOn that note, **don't have a large army**. Build military units only if you think there's a strong chance that you will be going to war. This is especially applicable early to mid game when countries are not directly bordering each other. It's fine to have a few units around to take care of barbarians, but don't build more than you need.\u000a\u000aLastly, I recommend that you try to keep a gold buffer for emergencies. An emergency can be anything from an unhappy citizen to a sudden war, whatever seems important to keep your empire as a whole growing and thriving. Basically, **don't blow your gold on worthless buildings**.

VLooking at your sources, here's my take on them:\u000a\u000aSource 1 (NRDC article): Directly counters many of your statements.\u000a\u000aSource 2 (The Straight Dope): Again comes to a conclusion that counters your argument. It does cede that mixed paper and plastics aren't economical to recycle (that doesn't mean they aren't environmental).\u000a\u000aSource 3 (LA county propaganda): Literally just a poster. Yes you can get energy from methane off of landfills, but that is really not relevant to recycling. Most recyclables don't break down to produce methane, so you aren't losing that when you recycle.\u000a\u000aSource 4 (Waste Management): I don't even know how this is relevant. What position of yours does this support?\u000a\u000aSource 5 (Paper industry propaganda): Supports your argument that we are not running out of trees.\u000a\u000aSource 6 (EPA): Shows that there is a difference between dumps and landfills. Also counters many of your arguments.\u000a\u000aYou have not supported any of the important points in your argument. I'd very much like to see citations for the following points:\u000a\u000a* Recycling uses up more energy than landfilling.\u000a\u000a* Recycling also creates more pollution than landfilling all of our waste material because of modern technologies.\u000a\u000a* It costs almost three times as much to recycle than to landfill.\u000a\u000a* Aluminum and glass are the only things worthwhile to recycle.\u000a\u000a* It harms the environment more to recycle plastic, paper, glass, and all other materials besides aluminum. [Note: this statement contradicts the previous one]\u000a\u000a* 40% of the things we put out to be recycled is ended up being landfilled anyway.

I don't quite understand religion, I'll admit, but it's not hard to see the draw.\u000a\u000aBut just because you have one belief---among your many---that has more logical basis in reality than theirs doesn't mean you are better than them. It's easy to think it does, I know, but you're not.

But you may say, well, sure there is a lot of science coming out of the US, but it's all shit! Right? But no.

V1602 AD. It's a series, and it was the first one, so I expect someone else must have heard of it, but no one I've met has. I was 10 when it came out though, so it was probably an older audience who played it. But anyway, it's awesome! The game is based in the year 1602 (duh), and your object is generally to settle islands and bring in people. Your citizens want certain things, and at the start it's easy, the settlers basically just want to eat, so you just build a fishery, and they get their fish.\u000a\u000aBut once the noblemen start moving in, the requests start to get more difficult. Like maybe they want jewelry, which you need a gold mine for and a jeweler. And maybe you don't have any islands with gold deposits, and the only one is currently occupied by a rival.\u000a\u000aSo do you go to war to take that island with the gold deposit? It's a very costly endeavor. Militaries are expensive, after all. You need to build the military supplies like cannons and guns, which require steel and munitions factory, etc. and then you have to pay for the cost of soldiers. And of course now you'll need a powerful navy to protect your trade routes and assault your rival's island.\u000a\u000aOr do you just suck it up and buy the gold off of him (if he's even willing to sell at all)? Or just hope passing merchant ships can supply you with enough? That's also going to be expensive, but if he's very powerful, or you can't afford a big enough military, you might have no choice (for the time).\u000a\u000aIt's a game of building up supply chains and really developing your cities in a much more in depth manner than any other game I've played (the sequels being the exception). In terms of playing, I'd recommend playing the sequels, because game mechanic wise they are very similar, although I can't stand the voice acting in Dawn of Discovery (aka Anno 1404).

And did I mention my city didn't even have a castle? I admit I fought my best fight with the few units I had, and tried to use the terrain to my every advantage, but the AI should be able to overwhelm me with sheer force at least.

VIt all depends on the keyboard manufacturer. I don't think there's any standard on how they are set up. But I think there are two things taken into account: cost and likelihood of interference. Of course the fewer circuits, the cheaper, so I don't think that needs much explanation. But they also don't want common combinations of keys to interfere with each other.\u000a\u000aFor example, shift, alt, or ctrl should not interfere with any other key, because those are the most common to be held together. And similarly, holding combinations of them should not interfere with each other, e.g. ctrl+alt+del should work. However, it's very rare that you would ever need to hold BOTH shift keys at the same time, so the keyboard is designed such that those DO interfere as to allow for more useful combinations to be used across other circuits.

VNo, that is exactly what it is. Your keyboard has a matrix of keys and some are on the same one, and some aren't. You probably have a 2 or 3 rollover keyboard. It will let you type certain things above the 3 keys, but only if they are in another matrix.\u000a\u000aI have a n-key rollover keyboard, SO I AM PRESSING SHIFT WITH BOTH SHIFT KEYS AND I CAN STILL TYPE&gt; and now i am holding down capslock as well as both shift keys&lt; and i can still type&gt;\u000a\u000aThe point is that it has to do with the keyboard hardware. Most of the time you don't need to be holding multiple keys down while typing, so to make the circuitry cheaper, they connect many keys together to form different matrices of keys. This normally is okay, but when you start to use the keyboard beyond the capacity that it was designed for, certain keys (along the overloaded matrices) stop responding to keypresses.\u000a\u000aWith n-key rollover, I can hold any number of keys down, and my keyboard won't yell at me. Right now I:m holding all the arrow keys&lt; both shift keys and toggling caps lock for case&gt; It"s really difficult to type because I"m holding down so many keys&lt; but all the keys are independently wired on my keyboard&lt; so I still can&gt;\u000a\u000aThe reason that certain keypresses don't work is that the matrix of keys pressed causes it to seem like a different key is pressed than the one you actually pressed. For example, let's say that you are holding both shifts and press g, but the keyboard thinks you are pressing r because of how the key matrix is set up. The keyboard knows that the r key isn't actually being pressed down, but it detects the signal for the r keypress, from the combination of keys you are pressing, so it ignores the keypress all together. Not exactly how it works, but that's the idea.

VWhat if you share a computer with other people? Like a family computer for example. Even if you have separate Windows accounts, only 1 Steam account can be remembered per computer. It really sucks. It makes offline mode completely worthless.\u000a\u000aAlso, one of the major issues I've found is that when Steam detects an update it will often wait a while to tell you about it, potentially until you next go to start up Steam. Now let's say it detected an update and you restart your computer or lose internet at some point along the way. When you attempt to Start Steam in offline mode it will think, "Wait! Hold on a minute! I detected an update! Let me install that first, and THEN you can go into offline mode." But you have no internet, so it can't do the install. So it will say to you, "Sorry, you cannot perform that action when in offline mode" and boot you out.

VI don't know the history of dry stouts, but stout was originally the heaviest porter, and called a stout porter. So personally I think dry stout only exists because that's what Guinness called their style. Dry stouts don't resemble stouts in their original form at all, except in color. It's like if I made an ipa and called it an imperial pilsner and then it got really popular. It isn't at all a pilsner, but I called it one and it got popular, so now people call it one.

V&gt;I think my best bet for getting into more hoppy brews is via ales and lagers.\u000a\u000aAles and lagers are THE two types of beer. Stouts, for example, are ales. The difference is in the way they are made and the yeast that is used. Lagers are made at lower temperatures and ales made at room temperature. Lagers tend to be more crisp and clean, whereas ales tend to be more fruity. Ales are cheaper to make because of the refrigeration and some other complexities in making lagers, which is probably why you see more craft ales than lagers.\u000a\u000aAnyway, I have a few recommendations for you. I'd recommend you try some Belgian beers. Trappist beers are good, my favorite being Rochefort 10, but they are expensive. A slightly cheaper alternative are the abbey ales, which are brewed in the same style, but not necessarily made by monks. St. Bernardus Abt. 12 is my favorite of those. Another Belgian of note is Duvel, also on the expensive side, but delicious and absolutely worth trying. And lastly, you should definitely try Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier if you haven't already. It's the quintessential hefeweizen.

VIt probably does nothing. But it is a play on SQL injections.\u000a\u000aIn principle it works like this. Let's say I wanted to read information about the server using SQL from that. I might do something like this:\u000a\u000aSELECT * FROM servertypes WHERE servername='PLACEHOLDER'\u000a\u000anow if I replace placeholder with what the reddit servers have told me I get this:\u000a\u000aSELECT * FROM servertypes WHERE servername='Server:'; DROP TABLE servertypes; --'\u000a\u000aThey short circuit what I wanted to do by closing the quote and were able to insert their malicious code to drop the table (delete it).\u000a\u000aThe semicolon denotes the end of a command. This allows them to add another command afterward, in this case the DROP, but the command could really be anything. They could potentially also do something like "SELECT username, password FROM users", making it very dangerous if your system is vulnerable.\u000a\u000aAnd the last part is the --. -- is the symbol you write for an inline comment, meaning that everything after the -- will be ignored by the computer and not run. In general use, it is often used for explaining how things in a program work in english, for the benefit of other programmers, but that it is not something the machine cares about. I could do something like this:\u000a\u000aSELECT * FROM servertypes WHERE servername='PLACEHOLDER' -- selects the details about a given server\u000a\u000aHowever, in this case the -- was used to so that the original closing ' was not left dangling and the code is able to run.

VI agree that we are probably not the only advanced civilization in the universe, but I think that we are probably the most advanced civilization in our galaxy. Just think about where you see humanity in 100 million years. I see us as a huge civilization spanning across much of the galaxy. Now that is an extremely short amount of time on the cosmic scale, so if there is a civilization out there, it has most likely had hundreds of millions if not billions of years to establish itself before us. Maybe they are just VERY quiet, but I am skeptical of that.\u000a\u000aTherefore I think we are the only spacefaring civilization in the galaxy.

VBut just looking at the abstract, I can see that they did a correlational study between price and enjoyment. That is to say, quality wasn't looked at in the slightest. I do think that quality and price are correlated, at least in so much as higher priced wines are less likely to have actual faults. But really, even anything above $10 per bottle is unlikely to have actual faults.\u000a\u000aI imagine that a study between the quality of a wine as judged by wine experts would have a positive correlation with price (i.e. more expensive wines would be rated higher).\u000a\u000aAlso, there is a difference between how people with a wine education and those without one will rate wine, according to this study, and that makes sense to me. If you didn't read it, people with wine training will rate more expensive wines higher, where people without will rate them lower. Personally, I think that a lot in wine is acquired taste, so the cheaper wines are made to be more bland and unoffensive (a byproduct really of having vines with larger production), while the more expensive wines will have more distinguished varietal characteristics which people unfamiliar to wine might dislike for one reason or another.

V&gt;The fear came back to her then, with her brother's words. She felt like a child once more, only thirteen and all alone, not ready for what was about to happen to her...\u000a\u000a&gt;She stood there helpless and trembling in her wedding silks while he secured the horses, and when he turned to her, she began to cry...\u000a\u000a&gt;His fingers were deft and strangely tender. He removed her silks one by one, carefully, while Dany sat unmoving, silent, looking at his eyes. When he bared her small breasts, she could not help herself. She averted her eyes and covered herself with her hands. "No," Drogo said. He pulled her hands away from her breasts, gently but firmly, then lifted her face again to make her look at him. "No," he repeated...\u000a\u000a&gt; It seemed as if hours passed before his hands finally went to her breasts He stroked the soft skin underneath until it tingled. He circled her nipples with his thumbs, pinched them between thumb and forefinger, then began to pull at her, very lightly at first, then more insistently, until her nipples stiffened and began to ache.\u000a\u000a&gt; He stopped then, and drew her down onto his lap. Dany was flushed and breathless, her heart fluttering in her chest. He cupped her face in his huge hands and looked into his eyes. "No?" he said, and she knew it was a question.\u000a\u000a&gt; She took his hand and moved it down to the wetness between her thighs. "Yes," she whispered as she put his finger inside her.

VPretty sure it's not all at the state level. Admittedly though, the majority of funding for education and public safety does come from the state level.\u000a\u000aNow I'll amend my argument a bit and say it doesn't matter that they put in more than they took out. That seems more like a question about taxing the wealthy than anything else. These people who put in more than they got help the general welfare of the society from which they are citizens of. It is your civic duty. Not everyone can be intelligent enough or get lucky enough or charming enough or good looking enough to make the money that this hypothetical person makes.\u000a\u000aThe points about Russia and France are valid, so I will draw the line at citizens from a country owe that country. You are really a representative from your country of citizenship. It's almost a statement of "yes, I am from this country, and I owe where I am today to it". I guess you can denounce citizenship if you are on the other side of that saying, "no, I owe nothing to this place and would like to sever my relationship with it", but I don't know how the process works, and I'm sure it's anything but painless. So yeah, maybe that is a gap in my reasoning, but I think citizenship is a reasonable enough way to decide what country someone owes fealty to.

VBut that doesn't seem completely sincere to me. An American company that makes money in another country, like an online business, is not just benefiting from the customer in France, but also from the infrastructure in America. This gives both countries a bit of a claim over the income. It seems similar to the issue of interstate commerce (except it is international commerce). It is hard to say who has the right to claim the taxes. The problem (if you can call it that) is that there is no governing body above the countries that can take jurisdiction over international trade (like the federal government does with interstate commerce), so both countries involved want a slice of the pie, and in the case of the US, they take it.\u000a\u000aRereading your post, I don't understand why you say this can be incorrectly argued. Unless the company makes a completely new product with a new brand, new people, etc. then I think it's hard to completely rule out the role of the country of origin. And in that case, it wouldn't really be an American company, would it?

VAlcohol doesn't have to be bitter (or all about partying either). I'm sorry that you've had bad experiences, but there is a lot you are missing out on, in my (very biased) opinion. I assume you are referring to beer or red wine? There is huge variety in taste and flavor, and it doesn't have to be expensive to be good. I'd recommend white wine or wheat beer for you.\u000a\u000aFor wine, these are my recommendations:\u000a\u000aRiesling is probably my top recommendation. It is a white wine that can be very pleasantly sweet, with some tropical fruit flavors and a floral aroma. I had Relax Riesling a few months ago, and it was a Riesling that I recommend to someone new to wines. If you would pick up a Riesling, it's worth noting that they are usually although not always sweet, but on most bottles of Riesling there is a scale on the back indicating whether it is sweet or dry. I'd recommend something more in the middle or toward the sweet end of the scale for someone new to wine.\u000a\u000aSauvignon Blanc is more crisp and usually has an almost green apple or citrus like taste to it. I don't have a specific recommendation, but one from New Zealand is usually a pretty safe bet. I don't have a lot to say here, but if you like Macintosh apples, you will like this. If not, maybe Sauvignon Blanc isn't for you.\u000a\u000aChardonnay has an apple like taste to it as well, but it doesn't have the same acidity that Sauvignon Blanc has, so it isn't as "crisp" tasting. However, I'd say that for you the big thing worth looking at in a Chardonnay is one that has been oak aged. When oak aged, wine can get a nutty almost like campfire or roasted marshmallow aroma/taste to it, and Chardonnay will usually get very soft on the palette and have a slightly buttery taste. I'm not sure on a recommendation for you, though. Maybe California or Australia. To get a good idea of the style, I think you should get an oaked variety and one from the New World (America or Australia). By the way, if it is called naked then it is NOT oaked.\u000a\u000aFor beer, I recommend wheat beer or ANY Belgian beer. Hefeweizen is my top recommendation for you. Banana or bubble gum taste/aroma, and I swear there is no bitterness! Also, do yourself a favor and drink out of a glass. Most of your sense of taste comes from your nose, and you don't get any aromatics out of it when in a bottle or can. I highly recommend Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier.\u000a\u000aPlease, do yourself a favor and try one of these! If you want any more information or advice about what to try, let me know. I could keep typing, but this is getting unwieldy and you might just ignore me anyway. If you want other beer recommendations especially, I have more, but I already typed 500 words and don't even know if you care at all.

VNot true. I had issues getting into offline mode as recently as 2 months ago (the last time I lost internet connection). There is also another use case where offline mode fails that isn't as talked about, but is easily reproducible and doesn't require your faith that I'm not just entirely incompetent (the second paragraph).\u000a\u000aI have to post about this often, so I hope you'll forgive me for copying and pasting my response to this argument from a couple of weeks ago.\u000a\u000a&gt;One of the big problems I noticed -- and I'm honestly not sure why this is the case -- is that when Steam detects a client update, it will not allow you to enter offline mode. This poses a problem, because Steam waits before it actually goes to install the update after it detects it. I'm not sure exactly how/why/when it waits to mention or apply the update, but I can say that every time I've needed to use offline mode on my laptop, it has failed because Steam wouldn't start without installing an update (that it never told me about). Maybe you can prep Steam if you know you are going to need offline mode, but to me that is an unacceptable workaround.\u000a\u000a&gt;Another problem is computers with multiple users. When I was at my parents' house recently, I couldn't use offline mode on my Steam account (and play games that I had already installed onto the computer) because my brother had logged into Steam before me. This wouldn't be so bad a problem if Steam stored the login data on a per Windows account basis and not a per computer basis. This may even be a bigger problem (even though it probably effects [affects?] a smaller population) because there is no workaround if you want to use both accounts offline, even if you know you are going to be without internet.\u000a

VI agree. I find it hard to believe that massing a big science advantage early on isn't worth it. Gives me a great opportunity to build some of the better wonders too. And when I'm ahead in science, I usually stay ahead, so I'll always get first pick on the wonders of each age.\u000a\u000aAnd besides, science output is inherently higher late game, so the argument that the scientists are worth more science points doesn't seem all that convincing. Maybe if your production can't keep up with your new technologies/buildings from research it is worth it to save them, but otherwise it seems worth it to burn them. Personally, I think the opportunity cost of saving them up all game is too high.

VIt actually was not worth it when it got to that 620 million or whatever it was. The maximum expected value from buying a lottery ticket is about 66 cents on the dollar, meaning for every $1.00 you put in, you are on average going get a return of $0.66, obviously losing 34 cents.\u000a\u000aThis maximum occurs at around $420 million. But why, you may wonder, does the expected value not go up as the prize increases (beyond this point)? Well, the reason has to do with the number of people actually playing the lottery. As the lottery value increases, more people play the lottery. This drastically increases the chance of multiple winners, which in turn hurts the expected value. $420 million just happens to be that sweet spot where it isn't high enough that a ton of people are playing it, but still has a very high payout. Again, it never hits territory where it is worth it, even in terms of expected value.

VThat is patently untrue. Just because it has worked for you doesn't mean you can make a blanket statement.

So consider this: you have a computer with multiple users, of which more than one of those people has a Steam account. It's worth noting now that Steam stores all login information on a per computer basis. The first issue here is the question of storing login information and having auto-login checked. What if you don't trust all the other users, or don't want them on your account? Perhaps an immature younger brother? Well if you decide that you don't want ANYONE who uses the computer to be able to use your account, then you cannot really use offline mode.\u000a\u000aBut perhaps you trust anyone who could access your computer, well consider the situation of multiple users having Steam accounts. Since login information is stored on a per computer basis, if another user's account was last logged in when you need to use offline mode, then you are again locked out of your library.

Well they were about the same price as games are now. Game pricing has not adjusted for inflation at all, but something needs to adjust, so they make the money in other ways (DLC).\u000a\u000aSo it's really between having $60 games with DLC and having $80 all inclusive games.

With better hardware, games are also getting more and more complex and detailed, somewhat alleviated by better tools, but still requiring much larger production teams to create the big title games. In order to make up for this increase in production cost and effective decrease in pricing, games have DLC. I'm not too fond of launch day DLC myself, but if it's between that and games always starting at $80, I prefer the DLC. ($80 is basically the $50 a Genesis game cost during its heyday, taking into account inflation.)

VFirst off, Steam offline mode *IS* shit. It almost never works. Don't even try to pretend that it is good now. I regularly get locked out of all the games I purchased due to Steam's DRM. And have you even used Origin? Because Origin does have an offline mode, and it is implemented very well, at least much better than Steam's offline mode.

VMaybe not, but I think that my argument is well structured and hard to refute. Anger gave me the initiative to voice my position, so there's that at the very least. It probably wouldn't be so infuriating if I didn't hear about this every few months and have to vehemently refute it every time (okay, maybe I've only really HAD to vehemently refute it a couple of times).\u000a\u000aStill, it seems to me that Searle is trying to rationalize his position that humans are the best and nothing can be as intelligent as us, and even if they are it doesn't count because they aren't human. Through legitimate means, this can't be proved, so he turns to a thought experiment chock-full of red herrings to trick people (probably himself most of all) into believing that humans are smarter and better than anything else that can ever be made, ever.

VI absolutely hate Searle's Chinese room problem because it is based on an utterly wrong principle, that when fleshed out makes things much more ambiguous.\u000a\u000aThe crux of the problem is the "book". How large would a book need to be in order to have a reasonable answer for any given statement? I'd argue that it couldn't be a book, but it would have to be a library. It would have to be the biggest library in the world, by far, and it seems plausible that in order for this "room" to even exist, it would require some of the instructions in the book to be rewritable, or for additional instructions to be written given different sets of input.\u000a\u000aIf you don't have any sort of "empty books" or memory that you can write to, this scenario would be provably impossible, because it would require an infinite amount of space in order to have answers to inputs of indefinite length and with an indefinite number of inputs before then.\u000a\u000aIt becomes clear that by saying a book, Searle is purposely misleading people into believing that machine intelligence is simplistic and impossible.\u000a\u000aBut now let's say that you have a massive library, and some of the instructions in the books for given inputs ask you to go to other parts of the library, and given those inputs, you would record some other things, or change some other things, and eventually output something to the people outside of the room. You, don't have any knowledge of the situation any more than a CPU has knowledge of what it is doing or a neuron has knowledge of what it is doing, because they all have incomplete knowledge. However, you could argue that while the neuron doesn't have knowledge, the brain does. And while the human in this room doesn't have knowledge of the Chinese language, the "room" itself does. The human is simply working manual labor and is another red herring thrown in to make machine knowledge seem impossible. The knowledge is an emergent phenomenon, or at least that's my argument. Anyway, it's much more ambiguous when you actually look at how this "book" of his works.\u000a\u000aAgain, realize that no matter the case this room would probably have to be much larger than Earth, and the time between receiving an input and giving an output would likely be longer than the length of a human life.\u000a\u000a**TL;DR**: Searle is a cunt, and I can't believe how prevalent his completely flawed Chinese room experiment is.

VWhat is probably happening is that those units are [routing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rout). This will happen if a unit takes a lot of casualties or they get scared for some other reason (large enemy force approaching, cavalry charging them, your general died, they see other units routing).\u000a\u000aYou know there is about to be a rout when the flags above your units start flashing (and you will see their status as "wavering"). You can try to restore morale by rushing in other units to help or try pull them back. But if you have a general, he is the best way to help. His mere presence near your troops will greatly improve morale, and he also has an ability called rally that restores morale to troops that are wavering and will keep them fighting (however once they have broken, you can't do much except hope they regain confidence).\u000a\u000aThis is a big issue for ashigaru troops. They are not the bravest of soldiers and will often rout at the slightest sign of trouble. They are basically farmers that you recruit to fight for you. Samurai and other more expensive units are willing to fight for much longer and take many more casualties before breaking.\u000a\u000aYou can always see the status of a units morale and what is currently effecting it.

Building castles uses food and farms give you food. If you go below 0, your people start starving, which will usually cause rebellion somewhere and is generally unpleasant.\u000a\u000aHave a good mix of archers and melee infantry. Don't worry about cavalry, they are more trouble than they are worth most of the time and require a lot of micromanagement to keep them alive. In battles put the archers in front at first and then when the enemy charges you, rush out your melee to meet them and protect your archers.\u000a\u000aSet your archers in spread formation. Always. They should never be fighting in melee and it will really help mitigate damage from opposing archers.\u000a\u000aEdit: Just realized this is a couple weeks old, but hopefully some of this still helps you.

VOK. That's cool. But let's pretend you are going on a long car/plane/train ride and want to be able to play some games. You turn on your laptop to play a game, but nope sorry, you can't. Steam detected an update last time you were running it, and since it waits to install them and you can't start steam without installing them and you need an internet connection to install them, you are now locked out of all your games.\u000a\u000aAnother scenario. You are at home and your ISP is being shitty. Maybe they are doing "maintenance" which really just means to you that you are without internet for a few hours. Unfortunately, your brother was the last person to use the home computer and had his Steam account logged in and he doesn't own the game you wanted to play. Well, you're out of luck because Steam will only store credentials for 1 account per computer, and you can't play the games that are installed under another account.

VOrigin has a vastly superior offline mode than Steam does. Offline mode for Steam almost never works when it's needed. I'd say that of the 30 times I've actually needed to use offline mode, it has worked maybe 10 times. The other times I am locked out completely. A big reason for this is that if Steam detects an update, it will wait until the next time you start Steam to install it, but it can't install updates when in Offline mode, and you can't continue into Offline mode without installing the update. Also, if you don't save your password you are locked out as well. Offline mode for Origin works like this: we detect you have no internet connection so we automatically went into offline mode.\u000a\u000aSteam does a shitty job for computers with multiple users too, because it only stores credentials for 1 user per computer, regardless of what Windows account is logged in. This makes offline mode impossible for at least 1 of the users and makes starting up Steam a pain in the ass, always. I believe that Origin does this at the Windows user level, but I'm not 100%

VI believe that it is highly likely that there is intelligent life elsewhere in the universe (and by that I mean a life form with a society that is at least as advanced as us) just because the numbers are so very staggering. However, other galaxies are so far away that whatever life exists in them is almost irrelevant.\u000a\u000aAlso, I think that there is probably unicellular life in many places throughout the galaxy, maybe even elsewhere in the solar system. However, complex multicellular organisms are probably much more rare, but probably somewhat common in the galaxy. And intelligent life in the galaxy aside from us is almost certainly extremely rare to nonexistent.\u000a\u000aIf there is intelligent life, then I'm disappointed in it, because it means that interstellar colonization must be difficult enough to be impractical. I say this because our very small society is very loud, and it seems likely that any civilization with even the slightest head start should be loud enough for us to hear without much effort. Once a society leaves the bounds of a planet or planetary system, it nothing should keep is from expanding until it covers the whole galaxy and the society would be big enough that it should continue until the galaxy itself dies. I want to believe we aren't all that's out there, but I think we are probably the most advanced society our galaxy has ever seen.\u000a\u000aMaybe we just haven't heard anything yet, but I'm doubtful that we will every find another space faring society.\u000a\u000a(Sorry this turned out to be a bit of a ramble)

There are only 5 or 6 employees, right? Lets give them $100k each. Then there is office space, which if they are renting is probably a few thousand per month, so we can give that 50k. But we can't forget that there's maybe another 100k for furniture and office supplies! Then they have distribution costs, and since the game is pretty widespread, I'll give it $500k (but that is a number I admittedly pulled from nowhere). Am I really off anywhere here? That adds up to a little over a million, so assuming I'm off by 100% brings it to a bit over 2 million.\u000a\u000aTake even another 50% off of that from tariffs/taxes, and your still sitting at close to 20 million in profit.

VYour body will transmit different frequencies of sound to your eardrums at different intensities depending on the location of the sound, which then allows you to place the location of a sound, even if its in front of you or behind you.\u000a\u000aAn interesting experiment was done to see how sound localization was affected if you changed the shape of someone's ears (and thus the acoustics of them) by placing molds on them. It turned out that at first, they had a very difficult time figuring out where sounds were coming from, but over the course of a few weeks they started to get used to their new ears and were able to do a decent job figuring out where sounds were coming from.\u000a\u000a[Link to the study](http://www.mbfys.ru.nl/~johnvo/papers/nn98.pdf)

VIt's actually fairly simple and should take about 40 minutes (and most of that time you can just let it install while you do other things). I'm assuming you had a Windows laptop, because it would be an impressive feat to download enough software with Mac viruses to take down your computer. Anyway, to start the install, you'll need to put in the Windows disk that came with your laptop.  I'll stop here while you search through your desk frantically looking for it...\u000a\u000aOkay good, you found it! I thought for sure it was gone.* Now put the disk in and when it says press any key to enter setup, press any key to enter setup. (If you don't get that menu, when you start the laptop bash F2 to bring up the boot menu and click to boot from the CD-ROM drive) It might say it detects that you already have a copy of windows installed, and ask if you want to repair. Say no, and that you want to do a clean install.\u000a\u000aYou are now on your way. Continue blindly through any prompts and you will probably get to a menu that will have 1 or 2 partitions (sections that the hard disk is broken into). One of these will be your Windows installation and if there is another it will be a small partition that has hardware drivers, and there might be another labeled free space. If there are multiple, delete the one labeled as a Windows partition, and if none are, just delete the largest one until you have mostly free space. Press to install windows on a new partition. Use default settings (should be NTFS formatted with all available free space). It will then install windows and restart. After that, the rest of the setup is pretty self explanatory. Just fill in any information it asks for. It will probably ask for a product key, which you should be able to find on the bottom of the laptop.\u000a\u000a*In the event that it actually is gone, there are alternative routes you can take, but I'm not going to go into it unless that's the case and you actually care enough to fix the computer.\u000a\u000aAlso, if it was actually a Mac, I'm pretty sure the steps are going to be relatively similar, but I don't know from experience exactly how it goes.

The democrats have taken the opposite stance.\u000a\u000aI agree that a 2 party system is not good, but it is an extremely stable system, and I mean that in the most negative way possible. It is simply not possible to change under the current voting system. What we need is to implement a type of approval voting or runoff voting system that would corrode the strength of the 2 party system, but it would be almost impossible to pass because both parties would recognize the loss of power that they would see and quickly snuff it out.\u000a\u000aIt's clear that things need to change, but the system has so much momentum and power that I don't know how it would be possible.

Decoupling origin ID and soldier names basically requires just changing a couple tables around and adding the function to update your name in battlelog, very simple. Customizing weapon loadout in battlelog is probably the hardest change to program from your list, but it is still just developing a new web interface, which is pretty easy.\u000a\u000aThey are going to make the easy changes first before taking on the bigger game changing tasks.

It just requires empathy, as far as I can tell. But that is only one side of it.

I wasn't ever a fan, and I found the rampant post-9/11 nationalism sickening, but people had their pride hurt and were angry, so when Bush directed their anger towards Iraq, no one was going to question it. The Wall St. bailouts helped the economy AND the government is making profit off of it (but the auto industry bailout - not so much). The denial of civil liberties, that was another Bush era issue. That has for the most part extended to the present, which is unfortunate, so I'll at least grant you that.\u000a\u000aVoting reform IS the biggest issue in my mind, but no, both parties are not equally evil.

VA decent reason as to the long kill cam is revives. Once it goes to the deployment menu, you are dead. Until then, you're still alive (or at least that's my understanding). When the kill-cam is turned off, you get a nice 5 seconds of watching your (almost) dead body before going to the menu.

V&gt;Being is an extremely broad concept encompassing subjective and objective features of reality and existence. Anything that partakes in being is also called a "being", though often this use is limited to entities that have subjectivity (as in the expression "human being"). So broad a notion has inevitably been elusive and controversial in the history of philosophy, beginning in western philosophy with attempts among the pre-Socratics to deploy it intelligibly.\u000a\u000a&gt;Existence has been variously defined by sources. In common usage, it is the world we are aware or conscious of through our senses, and that persists independently without them. Others define it as everything that is, or simply everything. Finally, some define it to be everything that most people believe in. Aristotle relates the concept to causality.\u000a\u000aAnd yet again you attempt to shield yourself behind false words. Not only did you not satisfy my curiosity about how this was even remotely related to the original subject, but now you use words that rely on **subjectivity**.\u000a\u000a\u000aLet me tell you **my** view of your God. God was created by people who couldn't explain phenomena going on around them, and couldn't be bothered to find a logical solution. Since they didn't want to admit the insolubility of the issues they were facing, they blamed everything they didn't know on a mysterious third party, whose intentions and objectives are unclear, to say the least. Times have past, we now know more about the world than we ever did - and we add a bit to the books each day, through the collective experience of human societies and scientific experimentation.\u000a\u000a\u000aWe now know what truly causes diseases (or at least most of them), we know that we don't live on top of a turtle, that the world isn't round, that the moon isn't made of cheese, that the sun is not pulled by a chariot. We have killed most deadly diseases of the past 2000 years by either adapting to the new circumstances, or with the help of science. And adapting to the new times is something religion refuses to do.\u000a\u000aEven today, using a device mankind created, communicating with someone halfway around the world instantly - something we only achieved after millenia of evolution - you persist in talking of a mystical "God" that I can not observe, hear, or perceive by any other means? If I have a moral sense imbued in me, it's because I received a good education, with an emphasis on what's socially acceptable and not socially acceptable. And it's because I chose to live in society, where I know that my contribution to society will not only help society, but also ultimately benefit me.\u000a\u000aYou talk about respect? Where was your respect for our religious and intellectual freedoms when you eavesdropped into our conversation and turned this, in a rather rude manner, into a discussion about your God? I respect religious people - probably more so than they respect me. However, if you stand in my way and try to sell me your falsities, I will not stand by idly and let that slide. I was perfectly happy before you showed up, having a good time with a few of my fellow redditors.\u000a\u000aI can not, and will not respect you, solely for what you've done in the last hour. I don't care for deities, or imaginary friends, or what have you. It saddens me that you feel the urge to spread your beliefs among strangers to earn some sort of relevance.\u000a\u000aAnd I, for one, do not wish you a good day.

It's amazing people now-a-days actually go against the theory of evolution, due to the simple fact that our excess wealth allows us to partially shield them from fatal diseases, conflicts and extreme cases of poverty. It is in no way our fault their society ended up like that. It's a sad way of putting it, but they have no one to blame but themselves. In order to get where we did, we went through wars, revolutions and a lot (a LOT) of work. And people around the world get a flavor of our hard work - however, if they truly want to improve their live's quality, it will have to come from them - not from U.S.

VYou mentioned singleplayer so i thought you only played the capaign or something. Either way, thee have been attempts of making 2v2 and other matchups a viable, enjoyable esport, which they are, but they're just underappreciated. There is this mentality that the true demonstrations of skill happen on 1v1, where a single mistake can ruin the game. No surprise counter-atacks or unaccounted units from other random enemies. That may also explain why some sc2 players don't enjoy the LoL competitive scene (no I'm not talking in general, just a percentage of the overall population).

VThis isn't going to please some people but LoL is easier than Starcraft. \u000a\u000aOn Starcraft you have to be giving 100% of yourself at all times, from beginning to end. There are no down moments, no time for distractions, you have to be on top of both your buildings, researches, minerals, units, et cetera. LoL is much more forgiving with distractions and down times. If you die, there are still 4 players playing for you. You have to wait up to 60 seconds to get back into the fight. You don't have to control every hero + every minion on the map simultaneously while managing income and production. You are not concerned about a bunch of flying heroes siping the nexus from behind. \u000a\u000aLoL originated from DOTA from the old Warcraft 3 game, which only used a fraction of the available mechanics of the game. LoL, having largely taken their inspiration from that model, only has a fraction of what Starcraft, a game very similar to Warcraft, has to offer.\u000a\u000aTl;Dr: LoL is simpler (doesn't mean scII players would be better at it, but they'd still find it simplistic)

VStop bothering to have logical arguments with religious people. They picked the non-logical way of Religion, over the logical way of science. It's their choice, and if they believe that it's a good idea to not get medicine, vaccines, blood transfusions or any kind of medical treatment, it's fine by me (as long as it's only for themselves). Means they'll die faster, and even better, they'll die a happy death (from their POV). If they don't want to believe in science, don't give them science. They can go back to the stone age for all I care, as long as they don't stand in my way. Then sh*t gets messy.

VAs a half-French half-Portuguese person, I think I can justify these behaviors. When I visited Quebec, I was well received. I spoke French fluently, and never asked them to say anything in English. However, the experience some of my fellow international exchange students was very different from mine. Some of them were left alone, because people flat out refused to speak English, even though most of them spoke it as well as any American.\u000a\u000aNow, the reason for this was that there is this big freedom movement going on there. Any american product would end up having a french(ish) equivalent name. This resulted in many, many occasions where people asked me to grab something out of a cupboard and I'd burst out laughing. They fight over french harder than french people.\u000a\u000aThey felt like letting people speak in English would make them lose a big part of their culture. If 10 people are in a room, and 9 of them speak, let's say, French, and the last person only speaks English (and they're trying to communicate), odds are English will end up being used the most in their interactions. Now, this can be problematic in one of the cities that receives the most tourists per year in the world, because with all those tourists, you'll find yourself speaking more English than French in the streets. While it may sound fun at first, this gets old very quickly, and people don't even want tourists after a while. That's why they grow cold, arrogant and sometimes just mean.\u000a\u000aIf you go out of Paris and visit any other spot in France, you'll (probably) find a warm reception and some interesting conversations. French and Germans are less likely to be fluent in English, because their language own language is enough to insure a bright economic future, and the population in their countries is big enough for them to not worry about meeting new people. If you go to Portugal, Spain, Greece (, Italy?), you're much more likely to find more people happy and capable of communicating in English.

They're riding in a wave so high they have probably earned their retirement several times over before they even start going down. However, this is not true for most of them, or else the system would be a lot different.

VI somehow feel like you are not the CEO of a major corporation. Ya know, at least most of them don't go there for the lulz. They actually make some pretty big decisions, and decide where the company / corporation is headed. Sure, most of them are greedy bastards that win untold fortunes, but in all fairness who DOESN'T want money for their hard work?\u000aCreators can go solo and make their own brand of products - some do, but this is usually met with some very limited success. Managing a company and selling a product is very different from just developing a product. You can be the greatest creator in the world, and yet have no idea how to advertise what you have to offer, and have no idea on how to start a PR section.\u000aPeople turn to these CEOs because they know what they do, because it's what they do best. And since it's what's they do best, they also get  a lot of money for it. Some would argue too much, and I wouldn't disagree - but still, this is the kind of world we live in, and there is very little we can do about it.

VI killed him. And fount an exploit: if an enemy is constituted by several independent parts (like turrets), if you shoot them at a certain angle that allows for the bullet to hit the main hull next, the bullet wil bounce back and forth until one of the two gives out. Since the turret has an independent health AND a shared health, you're dealing a lot of damage to the main hull before it goes down. Got him to half his health that way, and finished him off with my beloved shotgun. I've since killed a bunch more enemies that way. I'm currently *spoiler alert* fighting the warrior.

The people in his city viewed him as an hero.\u000a\u000aEventually he became batshit insane and allegedly started bombing civilians (there were some rumors that he hadn't and it was a CIA stratagem for him to lose popular support), but that really made a dent on his popularity.

When they find something that they can not explain in, let's say, astrophysics (even after using advanced theoretical physics theories for arguments), the most recurrent answer becomes "because god made it so".

The players are leaving because they don't like the core game anymore and they are finding alternatives which can either be (a) custom games or (b) completely different games.\u000a\u000aPeople are not going to stop playing sc2 because they enjoyed desert strike, they are going to stop playing sc2 because they no longer enjoy sc2. Placing the blame on custom games is missing the point entirely and will have the opposite affect of what is desired. Improving custom games will keep people connected to sc2 rather than having them leave for completely different games. \u000a\u000aIf it wasn't for custom games I wouldn't even load up sc2 anymore.

V&gt; If one side whispers "I saw it changing votes the one way" while the other side can show video evidence of it only changing votes another way, that's good information for an investigation, don't you think?\u000a&gt;\u000a&gt; The arguments in that case COULD be contradictory\u000a\u000aSure, but the case you describe is a hypothetical situation which you have contrived and unrelated to what we are discussing. In the situation which is actually happening there is no contradiction. If your made up situation did occur, then I would agree with you that video evidence is stronger than anecdotal evidence.\u000a\u000aI would argue that they are both worth as much attention as possible. The fact that a person did not record a faulty voting machine on camera is not a good enough reason to dismiss that there could be a problem, and where it has been identified that there could be a problem an investigation should be made.\u000a\u000a

V&gt; Real evidence of real fraud needs to supersede anecdotal whisperings from the other "side".\u000a\u000aThis might be true *when the two arguments are contradictory*. Which is not the case here at all. This is the crux of your argument invalidated. Video evidence of the machines making a mistake with votes intended for Obama IS evidence that the machines are faulty and SUPPORTS the argument that other votes are probably impacted also. The fact that there are witnesses who describe their other votes having been impacted further increases the reliability of both statements.\u000a\u000aTL;DR: The Obama video supports the claims that Romney votes are also impacted. The Romney statements support the claim that Obama votes were impacted. This is a technology fault, not a conspiracy.

From the top of Romney's button down to the bottom of the black checkbox beside Obama's name was all active for Romney.

Then there was "hold fire" which meant to never shoot until commanded to. Then there was "return fire" which stopped them shooting unless they were shot at, in which case they would attack the unit shooting at them, then finally (not in the same dropdown) you could tell them to guard friendly units in which case they would attack enemies which attacked the unit they are guarding.\u000a\u000aMy memory is a bit hazy on this but I think you could also choose whether they attacked buildings, enemy units or both.

I would also say that there is a very large number of people here who vote purely on emotion/passion/religious beliefs rather than on rational viewpoints.\u000a\u000aCompulsory voting makes people more interested in learning about politics.

When you question who you are going to vote for, you start looking at their policies and which one you prefer. \u000a\u000aThe crazies are always going to vote so you need to encourage (or force) more normal people to vote to cancel them out.

VI disagree. I think that the goal of the voting system is to ensure that every citizen is represented. At the age of 3 you are obviously represented by your parents who will vote with your interests in mind. At the age of 50 you will obviously represent yourself by voting for your own interests. Somewhere between the age of 3 and 50 there is a point at which your parents stop being the people representing you and you need to start doing it yourself. I think that 18 is a more accurate reflection of this point in life than 16.

V&gt; hell the decisions of the government affect them just as much.\u000a\u000aI would argue that people at this age are dependent on their parents and that the parents having the ability to vote is sufficient to ensure representation for the children.

VI don't think that 18 is the age of voting due to people being more intelligent or knowledgeable at this point. I believe it is entirely due to the fact that people become independent at this age.\u000a\u000aWhen you are 18, you generally start having to earn your own keep, living away from home and taking care of yourself. You are no longer your parents children, but are now your own person. Due to this, you need the ability to influence politics to assist your own needs. When you are younger, you generally live with your parents and are dependent on them so it is enough that they can vote and can assist your needs that way.\u000a\u000atldr; the voting age is (or should be) based on dependence rather than intelligence.

VTo my knowledge I was the first in my school to get access to it (through the university my father worked at).

(before everyone went through the frame-crazy phase).\u000a\u000aIt felt like 'the internet' had about 50-100 webpages on it in total. No doubt there were thousands of pages at this time, but it certainly did not have the same boundless, infinite knowledge feel which it has today.\u000a\u000aMy memory at this time was of my friends who did not have it, always asking me silly questions like "Are there pictures of cars on the internet?"

As with any game, the number of active players is slowly shrinking over time and so are their viewers.\u000a\u000aWe can pretend that everyone loves our favorite game because it is so mind boggling complex and has such a high skill ceiling, however this really is just what *we* love about the game. As the players skills are increasing and new/smarter strategies are being found, the fan base is *decreasing*. This is the life of a computer game.\u000a\u000aI don't understand why you are so discouraging of MOBA games as something spectators want to watch. I personally am not interested in watching a LoL tournament, but the numbers speak for themselves - more people want to watch LoL than SC2, and as long as we keep our head in the sand and talk about how much worse a game it is, we will not be able to follow their success.\u000a\u000aI do like the discussion you have brought here, so whilst I don't share the same beliefs, you definitely deserve to be upvoted for it. Thanks.

People require cars to travel to vote. *OHMYGOD CONFLICT OF INTEREST*.\u000a\u000aSee how stupid this looks?  Romney's link to the voting machines is almost equally abstract.  He owns shares in an investment company and a very tiny part of the many many things that this investment company has holdings in is the voting machine company.\u000a\u000aIt would be just about impossible for anyone to have an investment and not have some indirect conflict of interest.

Vbetting odds are only indirectly related to the chance of an event occuring or a particular person/team/whatever winning.\u000a\u000aThe more money is bet on one side, the more risk the bookmaker takes if that side wins so they lower the odds for that outcome and raise the odds for the other outcome.\u000a\u000aWhat this means is that it is the behavior of the people who are betting which determines the odds, not some amazing research performed by the bookie. We could have a competition to see who would win a tennis match between Federer and myself. Since I can't play tennis, the odds would be hugely in his favor - however if someone was foolish enough to spend $1b betting that I would win, then I expect that this would reverse the odds so that I was now the 'favorite'.\u000a\u000aIn relation to politics, what the odds that you cite are reflecting is the feeling of the betting public.

I have studied law but IANAL so am not sure what test would be placed on this question. Perhaps it would be the ['but for'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximate_cause) test. e.g. if the school wasn't paying for training facilities and sporting fields etc, would the cheerleaders be able to display their signs?

These signs were left there for display but the owner has not intended to give up ownership.\u000a\u000aEven if the signs were not legally allowed to be where they were, that has absolutely no bearing on who owns them.

The English legal system upon which much of US law is based requires that in a circumstance such as these signs, the sign must have been lost, mislaid or abandoned by the person who placed them there before ownership could be transferred to a person finding them.

It is a burden, and it is difficult to handle and that is exactly why professional sports teams have PR agents and coach their stars on behavior and communications.\u000a\u000aWe relate eSports to conventional sports due to the competitive nature of the activities, yet we are too quick to dismiss just how quickly we are throwing these eSports players into the spotlight relative to their conventional counterparts, and with how little preparation it is done.\u000a\u000aThe teams need to take responsibility for these incidents.

Get the book for about $20 and have a look for what excites you the most. I strongly recommend renting a car and doing a road trip for 4-5 days. There are a lot of really cool little cities which you can travel between on your way to some of the bigger attractions and they each have their own unique history and story to tell.\u000a\u000aYou should also consider a few trips away on the weekends to cities in neighbouring countries, e.g. Prague, Amsterdam, Zurich etc. I found that best thing about Germany was how central to Europe it is and how quickly you could travel to so many cool places - make the most of that.

I realize that the bet was just a fun challenge of your minds, but you should factor this into the exercise. Why would you or your father wish for the other to be sent to purgatory for 100,000 years - for what gain?

V&gt; If you find out that a misconception is wrong \u000a\u000aYou are missing the part that religious people don't find out that their religion is wrong. When you have "this is God testing me" as a valid reason to justify things which should not be justified, then you are never convincing yourself that you are wrong and it is indeed a misconception.\u000a\u000aSome theists do not allow this "we are being tested" excuse to justify the unjustifiable, and they do understand their misconception. We call these people atheists\u000a\u000a*edit: in regards to "you don't see X caused by misconception", [here is an example of 24 people killed due to misconception](http://www.armytimes.com/news/2011/11/ap-pakistan-afghanistan-mistaken-identity-could-cause-fatal-raid-112811/) I'm sure you could find misconceptions causing all sorts of terrible things.*

Why does a child believe there is a monster hiding in the closet?\u000a\u000aWe each have different reasons for our beliefs irrespective of whether they are beliefs derived from religion or anywhere else. If you are asking me to explain why someone else would believe that Moses walked on water, well you would have to ask them, and if you are asking me to explain why someone else would believe that forgiving our enemies is important, then you have to ask them. There is no single rule defining why someone believes what they do.

You just believe it.\u000a\u000aI think there is a bit of a disconnection here.

VI think there are two matters which you are bringing up here.\u000a\u000a1) What does a person believe?\u000a\u000a2) How should a person's beliefs be classified?\u000a\u000aThe answer to the first is the simplest. A person's beliefs are something which they need to decide for themselves. This might mean believing/following 100% of the bible in it's literal sense, or perhaps 100% in the person's interpretation, or perhaps 5% literal, 20 % interpreted and not at all for the remaining 75%. The point is that they get to choose what they would like to believe and/or follow.\u000a\u000aNow the latter question is where it becomes a bit more challenging. Is a Christian who doesn't believe Christ performed miracles really a Christian? Is a Catholic who doesn't believe in evolution really a Catholic? As with any group/club, I think that it should be the group themselves who determine which people are and aren't their members, not people like us.

V&gt; Launch day DLC is good if and only if they are not diverting resources during development.\u000a\u000aI see what you are saying here, but I think there is an important thing you have missed. The cost.\u000a\u000aLets say that the number of staff hired is enough to produce features X, Y and Z by release date and the total cost to be recovered (i.e. sale price) per unit to produce these is $20 per feature. Lets also assume that X and Y are required for the game whereas Z is just an extra 'nice to have' feature.\u000a\u000aYou can have your product released with X and Y as the main game at a cost of $40 and then have DLC released separately for $20, or you can release X,Y and Z all together as the main game for $60.\u000a\u000aOn the face of it, you would say that the first option has diverted resources away from the main game during development. I guess this would be correct. However the end result is that the customer now has the choice to get a cheaper game with only required elements or they can choose to pay the full price and get all features.\u000a\u000a---\u000a\u000aNow, whether or not this is actually how the process works behind the scenes is something which we will never know unless we work in the business and make the decisions. What is strange is that reddit assumes that there is no possible positive to DLC and that it is simply the companies trying to screw us over.

V&gt; but couldn't care less because we are such a small portion of the nation.\u000a\u000aRoughly speaking, atheists make up approximately 10% of the US population. From most predictions (espcially after last night), This election will be won/lost by a much much smaller margin than 10%. There is certainly value for both Romney and Obama in attracting this 10% to their platform. This of course assumes that atheists care about politics and are going to go and vote for representation of secular beliefs.\u000a\u000aMy point is that we do not present ourselves as a group of people who care about politics or that we care about voting or that we care about secular living. What we present ourselves as is a group of people who care about insulting people on facebook, pictures of famous people super imposed over images of stars and rage comics.\u000a\u000aI know that we atheists like to have fun too, and I also know that if we went super serious this is not guarantee of success - but I am sure that having a balance of serious conversation on here along with the occasional joke would be a step in the right direction.

Vhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_%28word%29#Capitalization\u000a\u000a&gt; The use of capitalization, as for a proper noun, has persisted to disambiguate the concept of a singular God, specifically the Christian God, from pagan deities for which lower case god has continued to be applied, mirroring the use of Latin deus. Pronouns referring to God are also often capitalized and are traditionally in the masculine gender, i.e. "He", "Him", "His" etc.[12][13] However, some people have referred to God in feminine terms, such as "She" and "Her". (See: God and gender)\u000a\u000ahttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proper_noun#In_English\u000a\u000a&gt; Sometimes the capitalized variant is then a proper noun (the Moon; dedicated to God; Smith's apprentice) \u000a\u000ahttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalization#Nouns\u000a\u000a&gt; Names by which gods are known are capitalized, including God, Allah, and Vishnu. The word god is generally not capitalized if it is used to refer to the generic idea of a deity, nor is it capitalized when it refers to multiple gods, e.g. Roman gods. There may be some confusion because Judaism, Christianity, and Islam rarely refer to deity by a specific name, but simply as God (see Writing divine names). Other names for the God of these three Abrahamic faiths, such as Elohim, Yahweh, and Lord, are also capitalized.\u000a\u000aTake your pic.

I do not think this is a logical conclusion as it assumes (a) that the recipient is capable of understanding the message completely and (b) that the person sending the message has intended for it ti be understood completely, which are both incorrect.\u000a\u000aYou are right about the weather comment - it was mentioned indirectly, apologies.\u000a\u000a&gt; I am saying if god says something that is clearly wrong (inferiority of black people or women) a later change in that view expresses that he is flawed\u000a\u000aThis is assuming that what god has said was interpreted and recorded accurately which brings us back to my point above. Humans are fallible, so if god existed (which he doesn't) and if he did try to tell us how to live life (he didn't), there is no guarantee that we would have heard and recorded this message correctly.\u000a\u000a&gt; You can't be omnipotent when you say something and change your mind when the underlying truths do not change.\u000a\u000aI agree with this, although this is omniscience (knowledge) rather than omnipotence (power).

VThat was a good read and there are lots of things which could be commented on, but I'd like to just pull one piece aside and discuss it briefly as it is something which I see a lot here on the board and disagree with it entirely.\u000a\u000a&gt; if the word of God was so infallible, then why the change?\u000a\u000aThis statement implies that God's word has changed and/or that God's word shouldn't have changed.\u000a\u000aLets discuss the former by way of example. Imagine you are a 10 year old child and you have just met Stephen Hawking. You ask him to tell you an interesting fact and he starts discussing the formula for black hole entropy. What do you hear? You probably hear "black holes are powerful and suck things in and shoot some things out" but that is about all you will understand. Now imagine that a physics professor goes to Stephen Hawking and is told the same information. He will most likely understand a significant portion more than the 10 year old did and will be able to relate the information learned from Hawking to their own knowledge of astronomy.\u000a\u000aDoes this imply that Hawking was incorrect when he told his fact to the 10 year old child? No. Does it imply that he has now changed his story? No. Most things can be interpreted differently by different people, especially over the course of many centuries.\u000a\u000aSecondly, the notion that even if God did change his/her rules/guidance is perfectly fine. What is appropriate many many years ago may no longer be suitable now. Do you wear flip flops in winter snow and jackets to the beach on a hot summer day? No, we adapt to the current situation around us.\u000a\u000a-----\u000a\u000aHaving gotten that out of the way, as an atheist, I do not believe in God and I see the various holy books as passages of text written by humans, for humans. However if I was going to debate a theist on the laws inside such texts I would not bring up the "but God was supposed to be infallible" argument, because for the reasons given above this is a weak argument with at least those two flaws.

VI would disagree for two reasons here.\u000a\u000aFirstly, whilst the tenets of a religion may have a foundation of a god, there are many parts of religious doctrine which are not necessarily tied to something which this god has commanded.\u000a\u000aSecondly, the idea that a religion should be founded on an infallible god is itself something which could one day change. Perhaps people will one day agree that their god does not exist, yet still agree on the values they wish to promote in their community. It sounds far fetched, but so would the idea of a black president to people 300 years ago. Alternatively, a change in religious beliefs could be attributed to a misunderstanding of what a god has done or desired. The Catholic church is a prime example of this with their view on evolution which is still being refined to this day. Heliocentrism is an even better example where the church was just plain wrong and relied on biblical passages to demonstrate their point of view however this belief is now altered to be in line with reality.\u000a\u000aDoctrines do exist which contradict reality, just as scientific discoveries are often found and conclusions drawn which contradict reality. People make mistakes all the time. The only difference between religion and other areas is the pace at which they adapt to change.\u000a\u000a

To identify when things are not as we had expected and to adjust our expectations and knowledge accordingly. We do this *all the time*.\u000a\u000aWhy then is it that people here on /r/atheism are so upset when a religious organization also displays that they are an organic movement, capable of adapting to changes in society. We are ok when any other organization changes their structure or their rules or their beliefs but when it comes to religion, you guys just can't fathom that things have not stayed the same since inception.\u000a\u000aReligion should change over time.

Literally does not mean "very much" or "really really".\u000a\u000aAlso, you need to think of debt and unemployment as being relative. No-one on this planet has the ability to choose levels of debt or unemployment. They are presented with a scenario and they can alter it to make it better than it may otherwise have been or worse than it may otherwise have been. The scenario which Obama got was terrible. No-one could have prevented a recession. The question which we need to ask is whether he did a good job of damage control (could it have been worse?) or did he make the problem larger (could it have been better?).\u000a\u000aDo you believe that anyone is perfect? I don't. If someone told me that they were complete then this either means that they must be perfect, or they must be imperfect and not interested in improving. I prefer someone to admit they are imperfect and have a desire to improve. i.e. someone who admits they are incomplete.

It is easy for us to view this issue as purely a technical software/networking issue when in fact the reality is so much larger than this.

There is no evidence to suggest that a computer scientist would refuse bribes from special interest groups either.

Likewise, generating legislation is a skill which should be done by legal professionals and when they write legislation in a particular field they should consult experts in that field (e.g. a computer science expert in your example).\u000a\u000aI say this as someone who has a computer science degree and most of a law degree.

My father thought it might be because the bulb was screwed in incorrectly, but I'm not quite sure how that would cause this.

This is 28 bits total, per unit.\u000a\u000aTo transmit data for all 500 units every second, you would need 13,000 bits of data per packet. This is equal to **1.5kb/s** bandwidth. This is uncompressed data too. In reality you could make that figure significantly smaller.\u000a\u000aHoly fucking shit man! Where the hell are we going to find the technology to send 1.5kb/s of data! That is so fucking crazy and impossible, the internet will NEVER be that fast in one million years!\u000a\u000aGo back to your school of "I don't know a fucking thing about computing but will try and lecture people about it anyway".

VI understand your desire to equate morality with benefiting the human race and bringing about happiness and peace and health etc. That is what I want as my moral compass too and it is what I wish everyone's morals would point them towards. To this extent, you and I really do agree with eachother and are on the same page.\u000a\u000aMy contention is just based around the meaning of the word morality. By definition, it does not imply any specific behaviour or desire. It simply means that someone is acting for or against their own beliefs on what is right and wrong. It is a common, and incorrect assumption that our beliefs on right and wrong are all the same. You can provide as many of your own definitions and purposes for morality as you like, but they really do not match the definition which exists in the English language.\u000a\u000aLet's not argue further though, I think we have both presented our view adequately.

VI have done high performance messaging development at an investment bank. In that field, understanding how quickly you can transmit data is the difference between earning hundreds of millions of dollars and losing it.\u000a\u000aIf you want to go and tell me "something will cause too much lag" then that is fine, it is an unqualified statement with absolutely zero evidence given to confirm it.\u000a\u000aIf you want a meaningful discussion, then present your argument as such. Tell me how much data you are transmitting, what your network medium is and what your latency requirements are. If you do not know the answer to each of these 3 qualities then you are basically admitting that you are making shit up.\u000a\u000atl;dr: I understand exactly what he is saying.

VI think this comes down to a misunderstanding of morality rather than us actually disagreeing on what is good/bad.\u000a\u000aThe definition which you have given for morality is actually just a definition for what *you* view as moral/immoral.\u000a\u000aIf you were to look up the actual definition of the term, you would see this:\u000a\u000a*Morality* (formatting is messed - bottom 3 are all oxford)\u000a\u000a1. conformity to the rules of right conduct  (dictionary.com)\u000a\u000a2. principles concerning the distinction between right and wrong or good and bad behaviour\u000a- a particular system of values and principles of conduct\u000a- the extent to which an action is right or wrong\u000a(oxford dictionary).\u000a\u000aAs you can see, morality is just whether or not you abide by your own rules/views determining what is right and what is wrong. I view abortion as right in some instances, so for me, a person having an abortion is moral. A Christian views abortion as wrong, so for them, having an abortion is immoral. Neither of us are correct and neither of us are incorrect.\u000a\u000a&gt; If someone believes murder is moral because they use their religion as a moral compass and it tells them murder is ok, this does not mean murder is moral.\u000a\u000aYes it does. That is the very definition of the word moral. Just because something is immoral to you does not mean that it is immoral to another person. Morality is relative.\u000a\u000aThis same applies to the simpy clothing example. If someone's belief is that skimpy clothing is bad, then it is immoral in that person's eyes. If someone else thinks that skimpy clothing is fine, then it is moral in that person's eyes. Once again, neither are 'correct' and neither are 'incorrect'.

But then, Dawkins also is no longer relevant. The fact that Dawkins is shown in this image must logically imply that the image is making a statement about what the people have done, not the reason they have done it.

To them, following their religion is the most moral thing they could do. If you find their actions immoral then this is because you have differing beliefs - not every person has the same view on what is and isn't moral (e.g. various opinions on skimpy clothing throughout the world).

Vscans present an interesting problem. Perhaps as soon as a command center is selected you would begin monitoring all other units, or perhaps you wait until the scan icon is clicked (or hotkey selected).\u000a\u000aThe important point is that you don't need to have programs (client or server) checking all of the information, all of the time.

Why do you believe the bible is true?\u000a\u000aThe bible is a collection of books, written by many authors, over a long period of time. Each author had a different level of knowledge and each author had their own bias and agenda.\u000a\u000aDo you believe that the bible is true/correct simply because someone has told you to believe it? If someone had told you to believe a different book was true/correct would you just as easily have believed in this other book instead?\u000a\u000aUnlike the majority of people on this forum, I do not hate the bible. I think that there are some useful lessons contained within it. However, this doesn't change the fact that it was written by humans. Fallible humans. It is a story book and should be treated as such.

VGetting more energy back than what was put in is only referring to the energy used to manage the reaction. In this case I believe it means that the energy used to maintain the electromagnetic liners was nearly the same as the energy captured as an end product.

It does not allow any representation for the 14% of officers who did want the police to all be armed.\u000a\u000aIf you want to fudge a number to represent all the police, then you would have to make the assumption that the 14% of officers who wanted police to be armed would all remain in their jobs if this happened (i.e. not resign) and then your figure would be 45.92% (calculated, not quoted in the article).

They were proposing just handing out money to people who earned under a certain amount. I do not think this was a good solution to fix the economy, and was (and still am) opposed to such handouts, but I'll be damned if I am not going to accept that money when it is my taxes which are paying for it.\u000a\u000a*edit: not entirely sure why this is only getting downvotes. If your leader proposed a tax cut and you didn't think it was a good idea, would you pay extra tax to negate that cut whilst everyone else pays the reduced amout?

VI think there has been a misunderstanding here. I haven't stated that there is no incentive to learn a different language, I am saying that the incentive to learn English is greater. \u000a\u000aTo give some perspective, I have lived and worked on three different continents and travelled and done business across many many countries (I'm not American and I do know more than one language if that helps remove any prejudice of arrogance). I realise that there are people who are much more 'worldly' than myself, but I believe that I am well ahead of your average person in terms of travelling and experiencing what is required to live and deal with different cultures.\u000a\u000aI haven't stated that there's not a large portion of the population who speak languages other than English. What I am stating is that if you have to learn one language, English will get you much further than others.\u000a\u000aRegarding your 29 french speaking countries comment - to keep this related to my comment it is best to judge how many countries can you not survive with English v how many Countries can you not survive with French. For example, in France they obviously speak French, however in the large cities you will be completely fine if you only speak English. The same applies for most of the countries on that list.\u000a\u000aIf you wanted to rank importance of language by the number of people who speak it, then [here is a good page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_languages_by_number_of_native_speakers). However this is a bit deceptive in our discussion as it does not take into account the usefulness of the people who can speak it. E.g. there is no use considering Bengali (3x as common as French) if we are never going to \u000aneed to interact with people who speak it, or if the people we interact with  can also speak a different language which we also speak.\u000a\u000aTo summarize - learning other languages is awesome, but if you only have a limited amount of time (which applies to all of us), then learning English will help a westerner more than learning a different language. Learning other things like instruments or astronomy or accounting etc might be equally as useful a way to spend your time as learning a language which is infrequently used.

VThis might come across as a bit arrogant, but I think it is a point worth making...\u000a\u000aLearning English is going to be very beneficial for travelers and for business. This is because a large portion of the worlds population are able to communicate to some degree in English and business is regularly conducted in English.\u000a\u000aThis gives a very strong incentive for people to learn English in addition to whatever their local language is.\u000a\u000aThis same incentive does not exist for native English speakers. There is not really much point in an English speaker learning French or German or Portuguese or most other languages unless they intend on going to live in these specific countries. Perhaps in the next 100-200 years we will be saying this about Chinese or Spanish and the native English speaking countries will be the ones who have to adapt.\u000a\u000aI think languages are awesome and wish I could have learned several - however I do not think that all languages are equally useful.

VDepending on the company/structure, there may not be any issue with OP's story.\u000a\u000aBeing a large company, I expect that they are very structured and the projects will be going through at least a 2 gate process with very clear requirements and funding. It isn't really at the discretion of developers to choose what pieces of work will form the deliverables. The project sponsors say what their priorities are - typically not the technical teams.\u000a\u000aWhen I read this, my thoughts weren't "this manager doesn't care about his product", but rather "this manager is making sure they deliver what they have promised and that they don't charge for work which wasn't requested. Further to this, *every* piece of software has issues and no company has the resources to fix everything immediately. Just because something is wrong does not make it a high priority. This is not to say that flaws shouldn't be highlighted when they are found, only that there should not be an expectation that they will be fixed unless prioritized and paid for.\u000a\u000aNow that OP has updated it does sound like some of his/her concerns were worth considering so it looks like a good ending for all.

V10 years might be reasonable in some industries. Generally the law will look at what impact this has to the employee and the business. A court will not ruin a persons life to uphold this term, so if you have no other career options other than one you have agreed not to compete in, and if you need a job, then the court will make the length of the term small. If you have other options and if the industry is one where your knowledge could really hurt the employer, then the court will rule on a longer term.\u000a\u000aThere are several well known sports cases where the court decided on very short terms as the sportsmen would lose their abilities and be too old to play competitively if the full term was enforced.\u000a\u000aThe important thing here however is that the court will not enforce a longer term than in the contract but can shorten it. This results in employers adding artificially long terms.\u000a\u000aTL;DR; 10 years is fine, it won't have much impact in reality.

V1) My worldview doesn't have anything to do with my lack of religion. I have no "good book" to tell me what is right and what is wrong, so I make my own morals up based on how I was raised and what I personally think is right. I don't murder people or steal things because I'm not an asshole, as opposed to "god said don't and I don't want to go to hell."\u000a\u000aBecause of that, my worldview tends to be more liberal. Gay marriage? Sure, why not. There aren't any secular reasons to oppose it. Things of that nature become common sense-based as opposed to god-based.\u000a\u000a2) A few weeks ago, I found out that my nana passed away, and it was hard. No one likes to think that this is it for us, which is why cultures all across the world have had different ideas about an afterlife. And as much as I would like to think that she's out there somewhere, still kickin' somehow, I just know that it's highly unlikely.\u000a\u000aI see the idea of theism as a chance. There's a chance there's a god and there's a chance there isn't. I've never personally seen anything that would make me immediately jump to the idea of a god, so the chances of having a god are low in my book. I'm not going to call myself an atheist, however, because my views aren't static. If a man tomorrow turned water into wine before my very eyes and proclaimed himself god, I'd be somewhat inclined to believe him. Even a 51-49 chance that there's a god would seal that deal for me.\u000a\u000aAs for your own death, indecision, and fear, I think it's fair to look at this world of logic in a logical fashion. Thousands of years ago, people used gods to explain the unexplainable, like the Reed (not Red, as numerous mistranlations) Sea parting for Moses. In reality, we have been able to say that there was a low tide around that point in history. There are similar explanations to things like the plagues and other stories which are heavily explainable. Entertaining the idea of a supernatural power in such a natural universe which has not known supernatural interference is as silly to my mind as entertaining the idea of the Loch Ness Monster or Bigfoot.\u000a\u000a3) I think that morals are just an instinctive thing in our society. All humans - all animals - are ruled by desire to survive, for the most part, and to carry on genetic DNA (care for children/descendants). Because human society has advanced, we now collectively choose rules that are better for society. As numerous movies and TV shows show, the collapse of society would likely lead to death. It's like collective insurance. So we don't kill people because we have order and society. It's wrong because the life or death of other people, in general, doesn't affect our survival or reproduction. If your life is being threatened (or the life of your children/grandchildren), cards are generally off the table.\u000a\u000aAs much as people like to pretend that morals are given by religion, it's simply untrue. When society began evolving, people didn't have as great a need to steal, in general. As society began evolving, religions and "official" moral codes were developed that said not to steal. At that point, it was almost unnecessary. A lack of stealing versus religious morals is correlated, but it's not cause/effect.\u000a\u000aThere are messier moral issues, like the right to life or abortion. When it comes to these, people tend to look to their beliefs. For instance, if I believe that life begins at conception, then no matter what religion I am, I'm likely to be against abortion. If I believe life begins at birth, then I'll likely allow for a choice for the mother regardless of religion. The difference is that some people are told from their religions that life does begin at conception or birth. The religion forces the belief, and the belief leads to your position on it morally.\u000a\u000a4) I'm not sure what you mean by grounding. If you mean "what's the point," then I see it like this...\u000a\u000aLife is the best thing you or anyone else will ever have. You can look at the universe and say life is short, but at the same time, it's the longest thing you'll ever do. What did my ancestors dating all the way back to the dawn of civilization live for if there are no gods (including the JudeoChristian god)? Well, one generation was responsible for fire, another for the wheel. More recently, there was the steam engine, the cotton gin, electricity, skyscrapers.\u000a\u000aWe all advance our society, whether you are the teacher educating the future innovators, whether you're a plumber or electrician who helps ensure the standard of life for future innovators, whether you're a government official who should help people innovate, or whether you're a police officer, firefighter, doctor, etc. Everyone serves a function in society that propels the next Bill Gates and Steve Jobs. They make innovations that not only make life easier on the day-to-day, but advance science and technology.\u000a\u000aWe can now send a man to the moon. I'm going to repeat that because it's just so amazing. *We can now send a man to the **moon***. We create these things and make society better for our kids. Whether or not there is a higher purpose, everyone has an innate desire to protect and ensure the survival and comfort of our children. So we do that by making the world harder, better, faster, stronger...or well, two of those things.\u000a\u000aA thousand years ago, people were essentially slaves to high lords who controlled everything. In turn, those lords were controlled by kings who were controlled by the pope. That's only one area of the world, of course, but that was the "pinnacle of civilization" a thousand years ago. Now there are talks of a moon colony, and we have enough weapons to destroy any world a thousand times over. We could destroy every planet in our solar system and still have nukes left over.\u000a\u000aWhat will our great-great^10 grandchildren have because of us in the 31st Century? Will they have abandoned Earth for a new, better planet? Will they finally come up with a way to stop losing the remote? What's in store for the future? What is our legacy. *That*'s what it's all about.\u000a\u000a5) Self-reliance. I'm not sure what that is. I don't frequent that sub often. Just based on the name and how it relates to atheism, I would say that since we have no gods, we make for ourselves. We won't pray away our disease, but seek treatment. When faced with a problem, we follow known, scientific solutions instead of banking on a supernatural deity helping us.\u000a\u000a6) I didn't have a bad experience with religion. My grandparents and mother are all religious (Jewish), but they're not so religious that they don't believe in gay marriage or evolution, etc. I wasn't forced to go to weekly services until about 5th grade (because my asshole father tried to get me to become Christian, so they decided to fight fire with fire), so I wasn't indoctrinated early on. I would say that I'm just too logical a thinker to place odds on something without any evidence.\u000a\u000aI said earlier that if there was a 51-49 chance that a deity existed, I'd consider it. Hell, if there was even a small chance, I'd consider it. I don't see a chance. The only evidence people have are either incredibly personal things/feelings which likely stem from not knowing anything else in many cases. If I grew up with the fundamental, unquestionable truth of a god, then the idea of a god would just "feel right," which is the main evidence anyone has barring explainable "miracles."\u000a\u000aWow, this was long-winded, but I hope you take the time to read it.\u000a\u000a**TL;DR: Religion can cause a proclivity towards a certain moral code, but it doesn't mean that it causes morals. There is no afterlife; we do what we do for our kids and our legacy; there is no evidence to support gods.**

VI'm not sure if I need to spoiler tag this, so tell me if I do. Rhaegar at some point, I recall, spoke to the Ghost of High Heart (that's her name, right?) and she told him that the Prince That Was Promised would be his child. This leads us to three possible conclusions: Rhaenys (impossible, since she died as a child), [ADWD](/b "Aegon, provided that Young Griff is truly Aegon VI Targaryen and not a Blackfyre pretender as many believe"), or Jon Snow (provided [Speculation](/t "he truly is the child of Rhaegar and Lyanna.")\u000a\u000a##AEGON VI TARGARYEN\u000a\u000aFrom Daenerys' House of the Undying Prophecies, it is shown that Rhaegar believed Aegon to be the Prince that Was Promised. This assumes, of course, that that particular vision was a true one of the past, not a fabrication from the warlocks in Qarth.\u000a\u000aAs we know from ADWD, [Spoilers ALL](/b "Aegon is  alive, having been stolen away by Varys and Illyrio and raised in the presence of a maester and a septon. Varys believes Aegon to be groomed well to be king. He currently has one of the strongest bids to be king, having already gotten the support of the Golden Company and Dorne, as well as taking Storm's End (according to Arianne II of TWOW.")\u000a\u000aOf course, some people theorize that [](/t "Aegon isn't really Aegon, but actually a Blackfyre. Specifics of the theory vary from Varys and Illyrio being Blackfyres, to Aegon being Illyrio's son with a Blackfyre. All these theories are all based on the idea that "Young Griff" is not really the trueborn son of Rhaegar and Elia of Dorne.") If that is true, then Aegon cannot be the Prince That Was Promised.\u000a\u000aThe other problem I have with the theory that Aegon is TPTWP is that [ADWD](/b "he's just been introduced. I feel like TPTWP would be a character who has already been established.")\u000a\u000a##JON SNOW/STARK/TARGARYEN\u000a\u000aJon is in an odd place. Even though [](/t "R+L=J") is so widely accepted on Reddit and in other ASOIAF boards, I refuse to treat it as canon until it is confirmed.\u000a\u000aHowever, Jon being the Prince That Was Promised would mean he is the son of [](/t "Rhaegar and Lyanna. Some say that they were married in secret at the Tower of Joy, making Jon a trueborn Targaryen. Others would say that he was just a bastard. Either way, he would be Rhaegar's son, assuming the theory is true.")\u000a\u000a[](/t "As the son of Lyanna and Rhaegar, Jon would be in an awesome place to exert power as Azor Ahai reborn.") [ADWD](/b "Provided he's alive, he is the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, has the loyalty of the wildlings, is Robb's potential legitimized heir, has blood ties to the King in the North lineage, and would be the true King of the Seven Kingdoms through the Targaryen Dynsty, coming before everyone but Aegon.")\u000a\u000aBear with me on my next point. It's been a while since I read ADWD, and I can't remember specifics about this chapter. [ADWD](/b "At some point in Melissandre's POV chapter, she asks to see Stannis, calling him Azor Ahai. Instead, she sees a prophecy about Jon's "sister" Arya/Jeyne. She believes the flames to be playing with her, but others believe")[](/t "she WAS seeing Azor Ahai by seeing Jon.")\u000a\u000aWith Jon being at the Wall with [ASOS/ADWD Spoilers](/b "Melissandre"), there is a chance he could be intertwined with the prophecy.\u000a\u000aNow, the contestants if we ignore the Ghost of High Heart's prediction that the Prince That Was Promised comes from Rhaegar's lineage, there are more candidates.\u000a\u000a##STANNIS\u000a\u000aNot exactly sure what about him was princely. He starts off as Lord of Storm's End, and then Lord of Dragonstone. He becomes self-proclaimed King afterwards, never taking the title of Prince. However, Melissandre believes him to be the Prince.\u000a\u000aWe really have no evidence about him other than Mel's assertions. He's probably the weakest candidate.\u000a\u000a##DAENERYS\u000a\u000aPrince[ss]? She's the daughter of King Aerys Targaryen, and sister of Rhaegar and Viserys. She was the princess, and then the Queen after the death of her brother. She is the first Targ to [AGOT](/b "have dragons in about a century"), and [ASOS](/b "currently holds the city of Meereen in Slaver's Bay with dragons, the finest infantry (Unsullied),")[ADWD](/b "and could potentially weild the finest mounted warriers (Khal Jhoqo's khalasaar) and the finest navy (Iron Fleet).") She's poised to fuck shit up.\u000a\u000aBorn amidst salt and smoke? Just as Mel claims Stannis is TPTWP based on being "reborn" on Dragonstone - an island surrounded by **salt**water and with a volcano (**smoke**) - Daenerys can claim the same. She was literally *born* on Dragonstone during a storm.\u000a\u000aMy own personal connection to Nissa Nissa of the Azor Ahai mythos would be that she [AGOT](/b ""gave birth" to her dragons on the funeral pyre of her husband Drogo. Some say that the deaths of Mirri Maz Durr, Drogo, and Rhaego were the deaths that paid for the lives of her dragons. Her husband and unborn son could be the Nissa Nissa, while her dragons could be her Lightbringer.") The prophecy also mentions Lightbringer being "pulled from the fire", which could be the pyre.\u000a\u000aI don't find these details to be much of a stretch, considering [Speculation](/t "she seems poised to cross the Narrow Sea as the Others begin to move South."). I would personally consider her a forefront candidate for AA/TPTWP.\u000a\u000aThat's all I have now. So far, here are my odds:\u000a\u000a~~**Howland Reed**: 1:5~~\u000a\u000a**Daenerys Targaryen**: 2:1\u000a\u000a**Jon Snarkgaryen**: 5:1\u000a\u000a**Aegon VI Targaryen/YG**: 10:1\u000a\u000a**Stannis Baratheon**: 50:1\u000a\u000a**Rhaenys Targaryen**: 10000:1\u000a\u000a**EDIT**: It was pointed out that Rhaegar wasn't told of the prophecy by the GoHH, Aegon V was. Rhaegar just interpreted it to mean that it was one of his children. This means that it's even more likely that it could be Daenerys and not Aegon or Jon. Thanks to /u/PeppermintDinosaur.\u000a\u000aAlso, apparently I didn't need spoiler tags. Oh well. I'm too lazy to remove them.

VMaybe it's just because by the time we saw Danzo fight, we've already had so many powerups that he had to be mega OP, but I really think this is straightforward.\u000a\u000aHis problem vs. Sasuke is that he didn't put his full strength. The entire time, almost up till the end, he wanted to take Sasuke out to fight Tobi. He spammed Izanagi instead of using his other skills at a certain point.\u000a\u000aWhile I don't doubt Kimimaro could deduce Izanagi, I feel like in a straight-up battle, Izanagi wouldn't be used as much, and he wouldn't have so many opportunities to gather intelligence on it.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, other things that you didn't mention like Danzo's sealing abilities (Foundation's tongue seal, the seal he tried to use to take out Sasuke) could work in his favor. I also don't see why you restricted him so he couldn't use his summon. Yesterday Jiraya and Hiruzen were able to summon Gamabunta and Enma repectively. Is it because you think he'd be *too* strong? If so, I find that to be a poor structure (limit powers because they're too much). What'll happen when we get to Naruto, Madara, and Sasuke, three of the strongest characters?

VTo be honest, I don't see Sasuke's motivation as "wanting to hurt the people who took everything from him."\u000a\u000aAs a child, he was left with a gaping hole. His entire world was shattered, and he was utterly, irrevocably alone. He tried to fill that void with hatred and dreams of revenge, to the point where that took over his mind, heart, and soul.\u000a\u000aBut it's obvious after he kills Itachi that he has nothing. Absolutely nothing. He tried to fill that void with revenge and he had his revenge. But that void is still there. And now it's gaping, because he has nothing to do, nowhere to go, and no one to make him feel better. Had Tobi not told him the truth about Itachi, I would see him getting very self-destructive and suicidal, not caring about a world without a place for him.\u000a\u000aInstead, he was able to fill the void up right away with more anger and hatred. He only had the Leaf to direct it at, and so he did. It was more trying to fill the void that was left in his life. Had Naruto and co. found Sasuke after he killed Itachi and before he learned about Itachi's double-agent status, I think there would be a good chance that Sasuke would consider returning to the village (provided they welcome him with open arms). Without revenge, he would realize that the now-nearly-nonexistant bonds between him and the rest of Team 7 was the only thing left to him.\u000a\u000aThat's why where Sasuke is now is so incredibly complicated.\u000a\u000a[Manga Spoilers](/m "He's spoken to his brother and the truth has been confirmed to him. He's been told by his brother to give up his vendetta against the Leaf. He wants so badly to honor the brother he loved and who gave up everything for him, but he has no idea how to do that. Protect the Leaf? Destroy the Leaf?")\u000a\u000a[](/m "He's on an adventure with Taka+Orochimaru to find out the truth. He's so confused now because while he wants to fill the void with something, it has become hard to justify revenge to himself after talking to Itachi. He's hoping that "the ones who know everything" are going to give him the answers to the one thing he's been all about from the beginning:")\u000a\u000a**TL;DR: "What do I fill this void with?" Sasuke's entire motivation has been filling a void, not exacting revenge. Revenge was just the means to the end.**

VCatelyn. I did a post a few months back about her. All she does and has done was for her family, her duty, and to a lesser extent, her honor.\u000a\u000aEDIT: Here's the comment:\u000a\u000aHonestly, I don't even blame her for [AGOT](/b ""It should have been you"") Not only was Ned bringing Jon Snow to live with them a slap in the face (remember how bastards are seen in the story; and just the thought of there being someone out there special enough to make Ned FUCKING Stark forget his honor) in many ways, but she was also out of her mind with grief.\u000a\u000a**Look at this through her POV, and keep in mind her upbringing: FAMILY, DUTY, HONOR**\u000a\u000a[Season 1/AGOT](/s "Her sister tells her that her brother-in-law, Ned's foster father for all intents and purposes, was murdered, but then, her husband is prepared to take all their children but their youngest and their oldest down to the capital, where these murderers live.

It's none of his business. He shouldn't have even been in the North. By all rights, he should be in the south with whomever his mother is, like the bastard he is. The walking slap-in-the-face is the last thing she needs while worrying about her family and blaming herself for her son's possible death.")\u000a\u000a[Season 1/AGOT](/s "Let's take it a step further. When her daughters and her husband head south with these accused murderers and backstabbers, a man is sent to **OPEN HER SON'S THROAT.** If he didn't have a direwolf, **BRAN WOULD HAVE DIED**, and so would she. But no, they both survived. Family, Duty, Honor. It was her DUTY to protect her children (*family*), so she went down south to tell Ned of the attack.

She goes up the Kingsroad, staying incognito so that these VERY dangerous people don't find out that she's on to them.")\u000a\u000a[Season 1/AGOT](/s "Then, wouldn't you know it, that same man who is accused of killing her brother-in-law and attempting to kill her son SEES HER ON HER TRAVELS. If they know that she's this far south, they'll know something is up. Tyrion will know that she is on to him, and there's no man so dangerous as this Imp, as far as she knows. Surrounded by people loyal to her family, she has Tyrion abducted and taken to the safest place around - the Eyrie - so he can answer for his crimes. It has been confirmed by Lysa that the Lannisters killed Jon, and Littlefinger told her that this specific Lannister owned the knife that was used to try and kill Bran. There is no doubt in her mind. All evidence points to him.")\u000a\u000a[Season 1/AGOT](/s "She enlists the help of a sellsword who betrays her.

Lannisters everywhere.")\u000a\u000a[Season 2/ACOK](/s "Her son battles the enemy and snags a few victories. But he's not safe. No matter how many Lannisters they capture or how many victories they win, Tywin has a large host, and Joffrey has her Sansa. When King Robb sends Theon Greyjoy to Pyke to create an alliance, *she advises against it*. Theon Greyjoy is not trustworthy. She knows it; why can't Robb see it? When King Robb asks his mother to go down and arrange a peace for him with Renly, she goes. She needs to do this to help their victory, save her family, and do her duty to her king - Family Duty Honor.")\u000a\u000a[ACOK](/b "Renly is killed in front of her, so she helps the innocent girl who loved him. She takes her on as a sidekick, for lack of a better word. She goes up north to her son once more, and finds out that she was right - Theon Greyjoy wasn't trustworthy. He captured their home. Now Sansa is in Lannister hands, Bran and Rickon are Theon's captives, only the gods know where Arya is, and Robb is at war and could die any day. Her lord father is sick and dying, and she is cut off from her home. Their only hope is to fight enemies on two sides, win, and hope that they don't lose their family in the process.")\u000a\u000a[ACOK](/b "Then, her son marches west into the heart of Lannister territory. She finds out that Bran and Rickon were killed by Theon. WHY DIDN'T ROBB LISTEN TO HER!? She now only has three children left to her. One she knows is in Lannister hands, the other may or may not be, and the third is on the front lines of war. The only chance she has of her children being returned to her is to release the Kingslayer. **FAMILY**, Duty, Honor. The chance of a family must come before her duty to her king and what honor she has left.")\u000a\u000a[ASOS](/b "She is imprisoned for this act of family. Her brother won't speak to her, her father is dying, her uncle and son are off at war. Sansa and Arya are both still gone. She was brought up to value family above all else, even more than duty and honor. But what family does she have left? What family *will* she have left when this is finished?")\u000a\u000a[ASOS](/b "Her son comes back and she finds out that he has married a girl. She seems nice, but this action is a betrayal against a prickly lord. A lord they need. Her brother is still angry at her, and her son tells her that after Edmure's wedding, she will be kept safe at Seagard. Pfft. She knows what this is. She knows this is to keep her out of his hair. She's failed her family, her duty, and her honor. She's lost almost everything.")\u000a\u000a[ASOS](/b "Her daughter is married off to the Imp. Yes, the same Imp who tried to kill Bran. The same Imp who killed Jon Arryn. The same Imp who took Ned's place as Hand after Ned was assassinated. He's brother to the queen and the Kingslayer, uncle to King Joffrey who chopped her husband's head off. They held her daughter as hostage and then married her - a delicate girl who still had rose-colored glasses - to a monstrous, murdering, evil, twisted, Imp.")\u000a\u000a[ASOS](/b "Then, her son is ready to make that bastard, that walking slap-in-the-face, his HEIR!?!?!?!?!?!?!? Everyone knows bastards are abominations. We're taught this from an early age by society. They can't be trusted. They're evil down to their very souls. And Robb is willing to let this bastard call himself Stark and be the patriarch of the family, the next King in the North? He didn't listen to her about Theon and look what happened. He has to listen about this.")\u000a\u000a[ASOS](/b "He doesn't.")\u000a\u000a[ASOS](/b "Then she does lose everything. Walder **FUCKING** Frey kills her son. Who knows what happened to her brother? Sansa and Arya may never see her again, and Brynden is holed up in Riverrun. Her sister hasn't even made an attempt to help them during all their trials and tribulations. She doesn't have anything left - no family, no duty, and no honor. Death isn't that bad now. She'll get to see Ned, Bran, Rickon, Robb, and possibly Arya. She'll see Brandon and Hoster and possibly Edmure and Sansa before this is over.")\u000a\u000a[ASOS Epilogue](/b "She wakes up. She was dead, but now she's not. Arya is almost certainly gone. Sansa is fled the capital, missing, if new has reached her. If not, she's still the captive of her husband the Imp. Her Ned is gone, her brother is captive, her uncle is under siege, her sister is still sitting high on her chair in the Eyrie. Robb is dead. Bran is dead. Rickon is dead. Hoster is dead. What does she have left?")\u000a\u000a[AFFC](/b "Vengence. Justice. Fire and blood.")\u000a\u000a[AFFC](/b "ell, not in the same way as the Martells and Targaryens. But of her own sort. Her heart has turned to stone. She has nothing left, not even her voice. All she has left is vengeance. So she kills one Frey. And then another. She brings her cold, hard vengence upon all those who have wronged her and her family. Fuck honor and fuck duty. Her family was #1, and her family was destroyed.")\u000a\u000a[ACOK](/b "Then, wouldn't you know, Brienne of Tarth shows her ugly little head again. Brienne made a vow to her that she would serve her. When Brienne went off with Jamie, she stopped being loyal to Catelyn. Brienne made allegience with Jamie, and was waving around a signed paper looking for a missing Sansa. Why would Jamie **LANNISTER** want her daughter, if not to kill her or force her to stay married to the monstrous Imp? And Brienne, who swore a vow to the Seven to serve her, is HELPING HIM?! The only conclusion is that she is going to bring even more horrors upon her only child left to the world.")\u000a\u000a[AFFC](/b "It is time for Brienne to choose. Will she be Lady Catelyn's woman, now and always, as she swore, or will she be another Frey, just looking to survive and betray her family and oaths in doing so? Will she help Catelyn bring vengence to the enemies of Houses Stark and Tully, or will she choose the Lannisters after all? Sword or Noose?")\u000a\u000a**END**\u000a\u000aLook, all I'm saying is that looking at the way she was brought up, the world she lived in, and the things that happened to her, I see Catelyn as one of the strongest characters in the books, and I really do love her, even if her POVs were sometimes boring.\u000a\u000aEDIT 2: Spoiler Tags

VCopying isn't the only use of the Sharingan. Also, he needs to transfer bodies, so transplanting the eyes into one body that he'll use up soon won't help. I believe it was implied that if he takes Sasuke's body, the Sharingan will be available in later bodies (it is acquired by the "true" Orochimaru - the snake thing - which transfers bodies) so when Sasuke's body is used up, Orochimaru can bring his Sharingan to his new body without having to transplant over and over.

VShippuden is a lot more thematically deep. It talks about issues like world peace and the "from older generation to younger generation" passing on of the wills of characters.\u000a\u000aUnlike the original, which was a bunch of sequential stories, Shippuden is really all one story. I would recommend you watch the show instead of reading it in manga. It might take more time, but it's easier to start off with the show. The english translation only goes so far, though, so if you want to continue, you'll have to start watching the Japanese with english subtitles, and then the manga if you want to go even further.\u000a\u000aA great site for all this is [NarutoGet](http://www.narutoget.com). Also use [this](http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Plot_of_Naruto) page to look up "filler arcs," which are generally of a lower caliber. Here's the episodes I'd suggest you watch:\u000a\u000a1 - 143: This includes a few filler arcs that others will tell you to stay away  from, but these arcs are good, and they contribute to character and story line development.\u000a\u000a152 - 179: The last few are filler, but okay filler again.\u000a\u000a181, 182, 184, 187, 188, 194, 196: These are also filler, so some might tell you not to, but I'd recommend these. Some are funny, while some help develop story/character for other characters.\u000a\u000a197 - 223: The last few episodes are good filler.\u000a\u000a228, 230 - 234, 238, 240 - 242: These are the good episodes of filler arc. People might disagree, but most add to the story/characters.\u000a\u000a243 - Present: All the rest is regular stuff. There is some filler mixed in, but it's fine. The episodes I recommend skipping in this section are 277 and 281.\u000a\u000aA lot of people give filler arc flack, including me. Even those two filler arcs where I just listed the good episodes weren't *bad*, though. We just don't like to sit through things that aren't considered "canon" while waiting for stuff that is. Looking back after rewatching, though, most of the stuff is good.\u000a\u000aFor your benefit, the first episode of Shippuden through episode 154 is dubbed in English. As far as I know, new episodes do not currently air, although they recently had on Disney XD a few months back. I believe they are now direct to DVD, so there aren't weekly dubbed episodes, just a clump that come out once every few months. The most recent one came out on 9 July 2012 with the previous one coming out in April of this year. From the pattern they have, the next one should be out soon.\u000a\u000aThe subbed episodes go from 1 - 287, and they feature Japanese voices with English subtitles. Many people will recommend the subbed over the dubbed, but I think the dubbed is fine. The subbed takes some getting used to, but it's not bad. The one thing that might factor into your decision is that there is more censorship of the English dub because it is meant to be viewed in America.\u000a\u000aIf you want to know where to read the manga, I recommend [MangaHere](http://www.mangahere.com/manga/naruto/v27/c239/), [MangaPanda](http://www.mangapanda.com/93-244-1/naruto/chapter-239.html), or (MangaInn](http://www.mangainn.com/manga/chapter/83747_gaiden1-mission-start). You can also try [MangaReader](http://www.mangareader.net/93-244-1/naruto/chapter-239.html), although a lot of people in the US can't view it properly. \u000a\u000aIf you want to save this comment for later viewing, here is a list of links to where the anime hasn't yet caught up to the manga (as of today...new manga chapters every week and new anime episodes too. To check whether or not its filler, check the top of /r/Naruto).\u000a\u000a[MangaHere](http://www.mangahere.com/manga/naruto/v58/c545/)\u000a\u000a[MangaInn](http://www.mangainn.com/manga/chapter/8507_an-army-of-immortals)\u000a\u000a[MangaPanda](http://www.mangapanda.com/naruto/545)\u000a\u000a[MangaReader](http://www.mangareader.net/naruto/545)\u000a\u000aStarting in the next few weeks, there will be another Filler Arc. I don't know if I'll recommend it or not since it hasn't started airing, but comment in a few weeks asking me, and I'll tell you whether it's worth watching or not.

VNorth: Starks out of Winterfell.\u000a\u000aRiverlands: Probably not the Freys. If Littlefinger puts his power behind the eventual winner, he might maintain a seat, but I think it'll ultimately be the Tullys out of Riverrun in the form of Brynden or Edmure.\u000a\u000aVale: The Arryns are essentially eliminated, with the exception of Robin and Harry the Heir. They could maintain the seat, it could fall to Littlefinger if he throws his power behind the winner, or it may fall to the Royces.\u000a\u000aStormlands: The Baratheons are essentially over. If Stannis takes over, then he isn't the regional lord. If he dies, then there are no more Baratheons. I would say that if he dies, it is likely that Daenerys will win, and she may hand the Stormlands to Aegon/Blackfyres for their support, assuming Aegon=Blackfyre.\u000a\u000aReach: I do think the Tyrells may maintain power. They were the last to abandon the Targaryen Dynasty. If not them, then I would say that we've heard a lot of the Redwynes, Tarlys, Florents, and Hightowers, that they are all contenders.\u000a\u000aWesterlands: Lannisters, probably under Tyrion.

VI completely disagree. The only thing I didn't like was the way the end of the flashback seemed unresolved. I'd have preferred a three-part filler that included a final battle between these guys and the Cloud ninja +Tsunade/Shizune.\u000a\u000aI think that it reminded a lot about Tsunade and Shizune. I had completely forgotten about Tsunade's hemophobia and Shizune being Dan's niece. I liked seeing the Raikake out on a mission - something we haven't seen of other kage in recent times - and I liked the way it tied in with the way they were perceived in Part 1 as kekkei genkai thieves.\u000a\u000aThere was a bit of character development. We saw that the Raikage cares about his comrades. So far, we've only seen his compassion for others as it relates to Bee. I think with a third episode, they could have spent more time on flashbacks with Tsunade/Naruto in Part 1.\u000a\u000aI think the War is a great opportunity for filler. We get to expand on battles from the manga, and also see the past of some characters we are just introduced to. The last few fillers with the Scorch Release girl and her student did exactly what I was hoping for. I'd like to see the same thing for the Cloud ninja we've seen so far (Darui, Omoi, etc.) and with the kage themselves. I'm a little concerned about this new filler arc, but I'm still open to it.

V*Cracks knuckles* let's go...\u000a\u000a1. Littlefinger legitimizes Alayne Stone and makes Alayne Baelish his heir. Remember he needs an heir if he's to have legitimacy as Lord Protector of Vale and Lord Paramount of the Riverlands.\u000a\u000a2. Sansa marries Harry the Heir and Sweetrobin dies, as OP stated. This cements her as Lady of the Vale, and being Littlefinger's heir, she stands to inherit the Riverlands as well.\u000a\u000a3. Littlefinger dies. Who could kill him? Well, there are other gameplayers. It might be a lord of the Vale. But my money's on Sansa. She's become a master player, and then she discovers he betrayed Ned or something. She kills him, inherits the Riverlands, and becomes Lady of the Vale and Lady Paramount of the Trident.\u000a\u000aOf course, the Riverlords might not want to swear fealty to a woman who has barely flowered, never set foot in the Riverlands, and has no real connection to them at all. And since Harry would be the lord in her stead (fucking sexism), they would see this as the Vale "conquering" them. How does she cement the loyalty of the Riverlands?\u000a\u000a4. She declares herself as Sansa Stark. Sure, she's known as a Kingslayer, but the Riverlords, the Lords of the Vale, and the Lords in the North don't have any particular love for Joffrey, do they? Now, by her marriage to Harry, she has the Vale, and as the successor to the King in the North as as the last Stark, she gets the fealty of the North and the Riverlands.\u000a\u000aNow, remember where this puts her. Ramsay/Roose are contending with King Stannis in the north, while all the lords in the North are waving their direwolf banners in secret. If Sansa reveals herself, Ramsay and Roose lose their supporters. Stannis doesn't have much support to lose at this point, but it isn't hard to take on the Boltons.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, we have Riverlords with renewed faith. Knights of the Vale pour out of the Vale and take a few smaller castles around the crownlands and Harrenhal. Sansa moves to Harrenhal to cement her claim to it by conquest (as she isn't Alayne Stone anymore, her ownership of Harrenhal could be in danger). Some of the Riverlords declare for her, but others still believe that the Lannisters will be victorious.\u000a\u000aThe Blackfish and Howland Reed, who both support Sansa, close in on the Twins with a small army, while Sansa's larger one moves up the Trident. Surrounded by the enemy, the Freys do try to fight, but end up losing.\u000a\u000aAs this happens, remember the turmoil that is going on in the South. Ironborn are raiding the Reach, and that is where the Tyrell fleet will be occupied. The Tyrell army will be fighting with Aegon in the Stormlands and Crownlands. Dorne will be supporting Aegon. Dany will likely land in Westeros somewhere with dragons, Unsullied, and an Iron Fleet, not to mention Dothraki. Where will she land? Some speculate Dragonstone, others speculate Casterly Rock.\u000a\u000aYou thought the realm was divided in ACOK with five kings? Imagine Dany and Tyrion holding the Westerlands with the greatest fleet, infantry, and mounted warriors along with dragons. Imagine Aegon with the might of Dorne and the Stormlands, not to mention most of the Targaryen loyalists that might remain. Imagine the infighting between the Lannisters and Tyrells destabilizing their regime as their forces are split. The Ironborn are fighting each other as Victarion tries to take the Seastone Chair.\u000a\u000aWho is going to aid the Boltons or the Freys? No one. Who is going to try and reclaim the Riverlands, Vale, or North? No one.\u000a\u000aStannis and Sansa will come into conflict over the north, of course, and there's no telling what will happen there. When Rickon comes back, as the true heir, what will that mean? With the Wall in turmoil after Jon's "assassination," there will be infighting between the wildlings and the NW. Others might break through the Wall. The wildlings might move South. The North might be as shattered as the South.\u000a\u000aAt this point, there's too much going on to speculate. I really don't see any one path as more likely than the next, but the sure thing is that Sansa will have all the power Robb had along with the power of the Vale, while the Lannisters have lost Kevan, Tywin, and Tyrion, and Cersei is currently out of allies. The Lannisters won't be Sansa's threat, Dany or Stannis will be.

VI think that the major one here is Theon. He is constantly reflecting that he has to remember his *name*, and whether he considers himself Reek or Theon changes throughout ADWD. He starts off insisting he was Reek, remembering his "name" that he was given by Ramsay. He tells Jeyne to remember her "name" that she was given by Roose. By the end of the book, he has to remember his true name, Theon.\u000a\u000aAs Theon is struggling to reclaim his true name and identity, Arya is slowly losing her own. Despite the wolf dreams and Needle, she is losing Arya of House Stark and becoming No One. It's understandable. There is no place in the world for Arya of House Stark anymore, and she's already lost more and more of herself as she went from Arya to Arry to Weasel to Cat of the Canals, etc.\u000a\u000aI believe that when Arya crosses the Narrow Sea, she will be a Faceless Man, no one. She will have Needle with her, but it won't define her anymore. She will run into Theon who will help her remember her name. He needs Arya, just as he needs Bran and Rickon. Stannis will execute him for what everyone thinks he did to Bran and Rickon, and for being a Turncloak. To survive that, he needs the truth about Bran and Rickon to  come out. Davos will see to that.\u000a\u000aBut what about the rest? Well, if he saves Arya of House Stark from becoming No One of House Nothing, then he is well on his way to being forgiven and redeemed. He will still be considered a Turncloak, and I don't think anyone in the north will truly forgive him for taking Winterfell and betraying the King in the North, but he will have earned his life back.\u000a\u000aThe same case could be made for him and Alayne Stone. I don't remember if this was in AFFC because it's been a while since my read, but I believe that Petyr will try and have Tommen legitimize Alayne so she becomes Alayne of House Baelish. This gives him the benefit of having an heir. She will become a mini-Littlefinger, and will lose the honor of House Stark as she gains the plotting of House Baelish.\u000a\u000aIt has been mentioned that Theon of House Greyjoy is the only one who could really identify the Stark children. No One wouldn't be able to identify her sister or brothers, and neither would Alayne. Who knows if Rickon can remember what his sisters look like - remember, it's been years, and he was only, like, three years old when they went down to KL - and Bran might just decide he likes being a tree more than a cripple. If anyone has to verify the identity of any of the Starks, it will be Theon.

VKishi said in an interview (no I don't have the source, don't ask me for it, just use Google) that he originally meant for Akatsuki to be mostly "mosters," hence why early members like Kisame and Zetsu are the most "unhuman" Akatsuki members.

VSakura was able to release the genjutsu placed on the bystanders at the Chunin Exam during Orochimaru's invasion. I'm not saying she's the most skilled ninja around, but if a genin with nothing special about her could release a genjutsu, I'm sure that some of the more skilled ninja could too.

V&gt;This will be long\u000a\u000aI said outright that it was going to be long. It didn't reveal much except for the beginning arcs of the S1 characters. No major spoilers or anything. Everything I said is shown in Episodes 1 and 2.\u000a\u000aThe problem with coming up with a short summary is that there are so many things going on at once, you can't adequately hint at the story in a short paragraph. OP sounded hesitant when someone said it was set in a medieval era, so I expanded on what it all meant.\u000a\u000aA lot of people who like Game of Thrones aren't fans of typical fantasy/medieval fiction; I am one of them. I also know a lot of people who refuse to watch it based on preconceived notions about fantasy/medieval fiction. A lot of these comments are great for people who have already read the books/seen the show or who are into the genre already, but there is nothing compelling about most of these answers because they can't describe the plot in 20 words without saying something like "fantasy medieval world with kings and knights and lords etc."\u000a\u000aI gave the minor plot points that the series starts off with, a brief overview of characters, and an idea of what the series has to offer that other fantasies lack.

Oth\u005cers may agree or disagree, but this is how I feel.\u000a\u000afiller | episodes | good or bad | description\u000a:--|:--|:--|:--|:--\u000aLand of Tea| 102-106|good| Team 7 goes on a mission to help a kid from a village win a race that may decide his village's fate.\u000aMiscillaneous Filler Arcs| 136-220|not worth it|The K11 go on various missions. The teams shuffle often during these arcs.\u000aTwelve Guardian Ninja Arc (Shippuden)|54-71|good|A boy with some Kyuubi chakra goes to Konoha, but is manipulated into destroying Konoha. Gives good insight into the next arc.\u000aThree-Tails Arc (Shippuden)|90-112|meh|I liked seeing the tailed beast that we wouldn't otherwise see. It has its good parts and its bad. Overall, I'd recommend it, but it does get boring.\u000aTsuchigumo Kinjutsu Arc|144-151|nah|It's only a few episodes, so it won't waste a lot of time, and you get to see another Jinchuriki, but I found it to be very boring and annoying.\u000aKonoha History Arc|176-196|nope|It's basically a bunch of standalone episodes about this history of various characters. Some might find it interesting, but it doesn't have a story and it doesn't add anything to the experience. I would, however, recommend 194 because of the kiss.\u000aAdventures At Sea Arc|222-242|NO!|Not only is this another bunch of standalone episodes, but it adds absolutely nothing of value. The only episode worth watching is 241 because Gai's penis.\u000a\u000aThere are some fillers besides that when you get into the Shinobi World War Arc. There are four episodes at the beginning that are just recaps of Part 1. Then there are a few episodes within the arc that expand the story. Fillers 257-260, the recap fillers, are not worth watching. Everything after that, in my opinion, is worth it.

VI will tell you as someone who doesn't like fantasy or medieval shit, I still love Game of Thrones. It's all about a bunch of people who play "the game of thrones," trying to take power. This will be long, but hopefully you'll read it if you consider trying out the show. No spoilers, really.\u000a\u000aIt starts off when the old king who was a war hero comes up to the north, where he asks his childhood friend - who is like the governor of a state in this medieval world - to come down to the capital and become his right-hand man (the last one died).\u000a\u000aThey head down, and the "governor," who is named Ned, begins to see that there are multiple schemers in the capital, all of whom have their own agenda and plots. The king himself is in danger.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, Ned's own family is targeted by the people who think that he's doing too good a job at protecting the king and helping him rule. His two daughters came down with him to the capital, while his three sons and wife stayed up north in their hometown.\u000a\u000aWhile this is going on, there are a few side stories. The first is a girl and her brother, who were the princess and prince of the previous dynasty (which was destroyed in the current king's rebellion), who are trying to get the resources to reconquer their kingdom. They are the only ones left in their whole family. To get the warriors needed to reclaim his throne, the brother marries her off (sells her) to a horselord, king of a warrior peoples who are feared globally.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, Ned's bastard son goes up to the very north of the kingdom at the Wall - a gigantic wall of ice 700 feet tall that has protected the "realm of men" from mysterious white walkers (called "Others" in the books). The white walkers had been gone for thousands of years, and now the Wall and its protectors only stand to protect the people of the realm from the "wildlings," a group of barbarians, in the north. The Wall is considered the end of the world, since civilization and law practically ends there.\u000a\u000aIt's much more intricate than that, though. I think one of the most compelling things about the show is that it's set in a fantasy, medieval world, but it features people who could exist today with the same motives. We see through the minds of different characters as they uncover plots.\u000a\u000aAnd the best part is that there is no one "arc" of the show. It's all one long story, but so many things happen that characters can go from "the most powerful person in the world" to "fugitive on the run" or "prisoner of war" so quickly.\u000a\u000a##SOME AWESOME TRAILERS, IF THAT DIDN'T CONVINCE YOU\u000a\u000a[Seven Devils](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Be6rfOMudiU) Warning: contains some minor spoilers that you'll probably forget by the time they're relevant.\u000a\u000a[Official Promo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XfAE3hIaPm4&amp;list=FLj1GpB4rc1PGig0sSNr2PCA&amp;index=11&amp;feature=plpp_video)\u000a\u000a[Another Official Trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWIyCUHrESk&amp;feature=autoplay&amp;list=FLj1GpB4rc1PGig0sSNr2PCA&amp;playnext=1)\u000a\u000a[And if you need any more convincing...](http://imgur.com/a/7tdgu#1)

VBut most of that was from ninjutsu, not from the other stats. If we're weighing the stats the same, then they are close together.\u000a\u000aNow, if we were to weigh the importance on each stat and how it relates to each ninja, that changes things. For instance, if Madara was perfect at ninjutsu, he'd get a 5/5. Naruto could be really good at ninjutsu as well, earning a 5/5. But in a ninjutsu battle, Madara would defeat Naruto easily. The stats don't take that into account. If Naruto had a 4.5/5 in taijutsu and Madara had a 4/5, the databook would show Naruto as a stronger ninja, even if Madara could still wipe the floor with him using only ninjutsu.\u000a\u000aA good example of this is Lee. He'd have a 5/5 in taijutsu, strength, speed, and I'll say a 4/5 in intelligence (and that's giving a lot). But for Genjutsu, Ninjutsu, and hand signs, he gets a 0/5. This would mean his total score is 19/40, which is pretty abysmal. He's still a good ninja, though. He can put up a fight using only his taijutsu.\u000a\u000aThese stats don't measure how good a ninja is in combat, just in the individual areas. They're poorly thought out. In order to calculate a good statistic, there would be more variables that need to be addressed (such as persistance - Naruto might beat Shikamaru in a fight just because Shikamaru would give up, actual skills not withstanding), they would have to make the stats more specific (out of 1000, for instance, gives a better idea of skill than out of 5), and there would have to be an algorithm that allows the person calculating to address individual characteristics, etc.

Madara isn't a 40/40 based on those stats. Look at his taijutsu. Oh wait, he hasn't done any. We haven't had any accurate look at Madara without his ninjutsu and genjutsu, so we can't really say he's a 5/5 Taijutsu, can we?

V##END OF FOURTH SHINOBI WAR\u000a\u000aI wouldn't change whatever Kishi has planned at this point. Too much has gone on that if I don't do things exactly as Kishi will, there will likely be huge plot holes. What I assume he's headed towards would be\u000a\u000a* Obito talk-no-jutsu\u000a\u000a* Gai's death via Eight Gates vs. Tobito\u000a\u000a* Tsunade sacrifices self to save other kage.\u000a\u000a* Oro and Sasu go to Konoha; the village elders are the ones who know everything\u000a\u000a* Whatever Sasuke learns makes him decide to turn against Tobito.\u000a\u000a* Sasuke finds the battle, and helps Naruto destroy Madara/Tobito.\u000a\u000a##END OF SHIPPUDEN\u000a\u000aI would have the Five Great Nations in a state of temporary-Alliance government, with Kakashi representing Konoha as the unofficial Hokage. There would be some sort of trial for Sasuke, with Naruto standing on his behalf and A standing against him. It would be controversial to have a trial, so it would be presided over by the Five Kage. In the end, Kakashi votes to let him go, along with Gaara and Oonoki. Mei and A vote to have him killed, but are overruled. Sasuke is granted citizenship of Konoha, but is forbidden from ever becoming a shinobi or using jutsu again.\u000a\u000aJugo and Karin decide to stay in Konoha, both wanting to be near Sasuke for their own reasons. Suigetsu decides to go out and search for the Seven Legendary Ninja Swords of the Mist.\u000a\u000aThe new elders of Konoha are Shikaku and Inoichi, taking over after the two current elders are killed. Orochimaru is still on the loose, and becomes the Alliance's new focus point. Meanwhile, the daimyo begin to discuss the next Hokage, arguing between Kakashi and Naruto. Ninja missions begin to resume as usual after a certain amount of time, with no clear Hokage announced yet.\u000a\u000aWith the end of the war, the shinobi nations end the Alliance, allowing the geo-political environment to return to normal. Naruto begins to reflect on the idea of peace in the nations. He is confident that the nations are heading towards peace, but until Orochimaru is defeated and the stability of the lesser-nations is established, peace won't be fully realized. When he and Kakashi are both asked by the daimyo which one would prefer the title of Hokage, Naruto turns it down saying he will be Hokage, but not yet. He still has much to accomplish. Kakashi is named Sixth Hokage.\u000a\u000aIn Orochimaru's lab, he resumes experiments on human subjects, trying to perfect his seal. He realizes that he'll need a new body until Sasuke Uchiha's is fully realized. His choice? A young man named Sai. Meanwhile, Naruto says goodbye to his friends in Konoha, ready to go on a journey like his master before him. Hinata decides to go with him, and he accepts her invitation.\u000a\u000a##NARUTO AKIPUDDEN: INTRODUCTION ARC\u000a\u000aTwelve years later, when Naruto and his contemporaries are twenty-seven, Orochimaru's body is starting to wear out, and he tells his new assistant that it is time for him to get his new body. It is revealed that he's been experimenting on Zetsu's body and injects some Zetsu into his body. He heads out towards the Leaf, and ambushes a squad including Konohamaru, Moegi, and Udon. He separates them and kills Moegi, taking her place using the Zetsu injection.\u000a\u000aNaruto and Hinata are currently living in the Hidden Rain Village, which is now under the rule of an oligarchic government in the aftermath of Nagato and Konan's death. The Rain, however, is attacked by a new enemy, a man who is the son of Konan and Nagato, raised by Tobi in secret. During the time-period in which Shippuden lasted, this ninja was living amongst the Konoha ninja using an alias, learning all he could about Naruto and his parent's other enemies. Blaming Naruto for his parents' deaths, he tries to kill him.\u000a\u000aWhile defending Naruto, Hinata is forced to give up her life, sending Naruto in a rage. In trying to kill Konan and Nagato's child (we'll call him KN, since I have no idea what name he'd have), he ends up destroying much of the Hidden Rain. When KN escapes, he brings Hinata's body back to the Leaf.\u000a\u000aI'm getting tired of writing now, so bullet points\u000a\u000a* Orochimaru takes Sai's body.\u000a\u000a* When KN attacks the Leaf, Sasuke steps up and saves the village, despite the prohibition of using his jutsu. He is hailed a hero, and Kakashi reinstates him as a genin.\u000a\u000a* Naruto returns to his life as a shinobi, also as a genin for lack of having taken the chunin exams. He and Sasuke are placed on a team with another older genin, who becomes a main character.\u000a\u000a* Orochimaru in Sai's body sneaks into Sasuke's house and begins injecting him with Zetsu hoping to cultivate a Rinnegan so that his body is perfect.\u000a\u000a* During the chunin exam, Sasuke and Naruto easily pwn and become chunin.\u000a\u000a* Sasuke and Naruto are sent on a mission to infiltrate and collect intelligence on the Mist, which Kakashi believes has been taken over by an anti-Alliance faction. In the Mist, Sasuke and Naruto are discovered and attacked. They end up being saved and hidden by Suigetsu, who has collected all seven swords and is leading a guerrilla revolution against the new regime.\u000a\u000a* When their safehouse is attacked, Naruto and Sasuke are forced to go into battle against hundreds of enemies, and are able to stand their ground. When Sasuke's Rinnegan activates, they destroy the enemies. Suigetsu is the main candidate for Seventh Mizukage.\u000a\u000a* Upon their return to the Leaf, Sasuke and Naruto are hailed as heroes. In the jonin exam, both pass easily again.\u000a\u000a* Naruto chooses to take on a genin team, consisting of Asuma &amp; Kurenai's son, along with a Hyuga who reminds him of Hinata as a girl, and a third child who reminds Naruto of himself - an outcast.\u000a\u000a* Sasuke, meanwhile, goes on to become an ANBU. Kakashi urges him to settle down with someone and restore his clan, but he's resistant to settle down with his two top suitors - Karin and Sakura.\u000a\u000aYadda Yadda, Orochimaru tries to steal Sasuke's body and fails. KN and Orochi ally to get their goals accomplished (kill Naruto and capture Sasuke). Naruto has some character development as a jonin sensei. In fighting Orochimaru/KN to defend the village, Kakashi is killed. Sasuke and Naruto end up saving the day. Naruto becomes Hokage. A lot of filler every fall.

Why would Kishi go through the trouble of having Sasuke go through the whole journey with his Sharingan, going from one version to the next, just to stop before the "final stage"?\u000a\u000aThe entire manga has played Naruto vs. Sasuke, Senju vs. Madara, the SotSP's body vs. his will. The ultimate battle will be the Rinnegan vs. the Will of Fire, Sasuke vs. Naruto. It's what the entire manga has built up to.

VI think a good point made by speculators of the Maester Conspiracy has to do with the association between Great Houses. Up until Robert's Rebellion, we don't really see much interacting (marriages, fosterings) between the Great Houses. Sure, a Bolton can marry a Frey, and a Tyrell might marry a Florent, but we never hear of a Tyrell marrying a Lannister, or a Martell marrying a Baratheon.\u000a\u000aThen, all of a sudden, we have a Baratheon and a Stark being fostered by an Arryn. We have a Baratheon engaged to a Stark, a Stark engaged to a Tully, and a Tully engaged to an Arryn. And before Hoster betrothed Lysa to Jon Arryn, he was trying to marry her to Jamie Lannister. That's a lot of association in such a short time, don't you think? For the first time, the Tullys are marrying other Houses. Rickard is involving the North in southron affairs. This was no coincidence.\u000a\u000aAlso, in the prologue of AFFC, Pate mentions that Archmaester Walgrave, the man once in charge of the ravens, often confused him with someone named Cressen, who we know to be the Baratheon maester. So one of these Great Houses has a maester who seems to be close to an Archmaester in charge of Westerosi communication (not to mention the fact that it is speculated that Walgrave was the father of Maester Walys, Rickard's maester.\u000a\u000aAnother interesting point to note is the way that GRRM connects his stories to real life history. Robert's Rebellion is much like the Trojan War. In the TW, Greece had political and economic ambitions related to Troy, and Paris' "kidnapping" of Helen of Troy was a simple spark to the war that was already being plotted.\u000a\u000aDuring the War of Ninepenny Kings, Hoster Tully, Jon Arryn, and Rickard Stark fought together and became close friends. When Steffon Baratheon died, they took the opportunity to have Robert fostered in the Vale, making their little alliance even more cozier.\u000a\u000aNow here's where things get a little tinfoily. I assume that Lyanna ran off with Rhaegar and R+L=J, by the way. During this entire Rebellion, I'm sure Lyanna and Rhaegar got wind of the Rebellion, fought on the surface in order to save her. So what would she do? She sends a raven to Winterfell explaining all. It only makes sense, right?\u000a\u000aWho got the letter? Maester Walys.\u000a\u000aWithout the dragons, the Targaryens relied solely on the loyalty of their bannermen and the strength of their army. Without dragons and with half the realm united against them, they didn't stand a chance in hell, did they?\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, there isn't that much that connects the maesters to Rickard's southron ambitions except for Lady Dustin's quotes and speculation. But I think it fits together very well.

VAs to the FM and the Maesters, I feel like the conspiracy/plans are only known by the higher-ups. They don't quite trust Arya yet, not enough to let a conspiracy slip. I feel like Jaqen has to be high up in the FM to get this sort of a mission.\u000a\u000aThe actions of the Faceless Men? Well, they are freed slaves from Old Valyrian freeholds. Braavosi have a reputation for hating dragons and anything Valyrian-associated (probably including Targs). Because of this, most people assume that the FM are trying to learn about the death of dragons to kill Dany's dragons.\u000a\u000aHowever, I am on a different mind. To become a FM, one must surrender your identity. The FM are no more Braavosi than Arya is, they just have a base of operations in Braavos. If they truly have given up their identities, then they are likely trying to hatch a dragon to meet their own ends. Of course, a good point to be made against this is that identities are hard to leave behind. We have evidence in the fact that Arya kept Needle and still has wolf-dreams, and we know that despite giving up familial names, maesters are still connected to their families.\u000a\u000aHowever, if we *do* assume that FM have given up identity and are truly no one, then it is safe to assume they are trying to hatch a dragon. Could it be for the dragon's power? Possibly. However, I have a different idea. Although it is in the show, in the S2 finale, Pyat Pree says that the warlock's magic is stronger in the presence of dragons, and it connects with the quotes that say that magic has been reborn since the dragons were born (I believe Pyat says a similar thing in ACOK, but I don't have a quote). The FM already use a sort of magic to be able to change faces, probably, so using magic wouldn't be unheard of. A dragon might even make their face-changing abilities stronger.\u000a\u000aThat would fit in with my idea of the FM and Maesters being at odds. The Maesters want to squelch out magic from the world, while the FM want to use dragons and magic. We would see the influence of the maesters over great and small lords alike face off against the power of magic and assassination. It would also be a neat angle to see the FM practice magic with dragons, inside a city which frowns upon the use of dragons at all.\u000a\u000aOverall, I don't see things becoming *hot*, per se, but staying a game of secrets and infiltration. We know that the FM have a spy in the Citadel, but could the maesters have a spy in the House of Black and White? Mayhaps. Jaqen might assassinate some archmaesters to put an end to the conspiracy, and something might happen to the FM courtesy of the maesters as well.\u000a\u000aI hope it stays a battle in the subtext, to be honest. I feel like a lot of people don't read deep enough to pick up these small details and piece this together. If all of a sudden, it becomes "BAM! Maesters vs. FM," a lot of people will be a little confused, I believe. If we just learn of the details from Sam and Arya's POVs, the story will be clearer to the readers, and we can enjoy a silent battle that isn't spoken by every sailor in the Jade Sea and every high lord in Westeros.

VI think that your point about dragons is true. We don't know for sure, so assuming might be wrong. I personally feel that Marwyn's assertion and the observation about Dany's dragons are proof enough, but others might not think so. The one think that I want to mention is that the Great Pyramid in which the dragons are confined is said to be roughly the same size of the KL dragon pit. I don't have the citation, but I do recall it saying that in ADWD.\u000a\u000aAnd I guess that the maester's distrust for Marwyn may not be because of a family. From his statement, I figured that they distrust him for the same reason they distrust Aemon, but that's certainly open to interpretation. It may be important, or it might not be.\u000a\u000aAnd I think that's a good idea about the FM. Everyone says they have to hate dragons because they're Braavosi, but if they are playing a game, I don't think they consider themselves Braavosi first. Remember, they give up their identity.\u000a\u000aThe one thing I have to point out is that Jaqen didn't originally need to go to the Citadel. He was heading to the Wall, but the war put a huge obstacle in the long journey, so he went southwest where there was no fighting. I don't see why he would have gone through all the trouble of being captured in KL and being brought up to the Wall if his mark was in Oldtown.

VFinal part:\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aFrom Sam's first AFFC Chapter, in which he notes how many books he brought from the Wall to the Citadel:\u000a\u000a&gt; *I should not have brought so many*, he told himself as he brushed the dirt off Colloquo Votar's *Jade Compendium*, a thick volume of tales and legends from the east that Maester Aemon had commanded him to find. The book appeared undamaged. **Maester Thomax's *Dragonkin, Being a History of House Targaryen from Exile to Apotheosis, with a consideration of the Life and Death of Dragons* had not been so fortunate. It had come open as it fell, and a few pages had gotten muddy, including one with a rather nice picture of Balerion the Black Dread done in colored inks.**\u000a\u000aAs noted often, the Citadel has the most extensive library in the world, including copies of every book. A book written by a maester would no doubt be in that library, no matter how rare it is. But why would the Faceless Men want to know about the Lives and Deaths of Dragons?\u000a\u000a&gt; "I dreamt of a man without a face, waiting on the bridge that swayed and swung. On his shoulder perched a drowned crow with seaweed hanging from his wings."\u000a\u000aASOS, a prophecy from the Ghost of the High Heart in an Arya chapter, in which she also saw Catelyn being pulled from the river and MelisSTANdra killing Renly. Don't have the exact pages.\u000a\u000a&gt; A man without a face\u000a\u000aWell, there's the connection to the Faceless Men. Dissecting this further, it is easy to make the connection to Euron "Crow's Eye" Greyjoy being responsible for hiring a Faceless Man to kill someone on a bridge. Hm... [Do we know someone who died on a bridge via mysterious circumstances?](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Balon_Greyjoy)\u000a\u000aBut what wealth did Euron have to pay for a Faceless Man? Well, we know he came across a dragon egg in his travels in the east. He claims to have thrown it away in a foul fit. Of course, I'm sure he'd throw out a valuable dragon egg just as any respectable pirate would throw a barrel of precious diamonds overboard when he's pissed. Yeah, I don't buy it. I think Euron paid with his dragon egg.\u000a\u000aNow, as an aside, when MelisSTANdra are trying to hatch a dragon egg on Dragonstone, a big deal is made that king's blood is necessary. Balon might count as king's blood for hatching the egg, or it might not. All we can assume is that the FM have an egg, and Euron got it for them.\u000a\u000aSo the FM have an egg and are looking for a book on the life of dragons. Interesting, but what does this have to do with the Maesters? Well, the maesters are anti-dragon and anti-magic, building a world in which dragons have no place. Not only are the Faceless Men hatching dragon eggs, but they have an agent, Jaqen/Pate/Syrio/Ned/Daario (jokes jokes) inside the Citadel. These two organizations are at fundamental odds with each other. So, can we bet on Arya assassinating Sam the Slayer? Not yet, but we can assume there will be some problems between the FM and the Maesters.\u000a\u000aNow, what do the FM want with dragons? Well, there are theories. I'm not too well versed in them, but I think the best one is about them being former slaves from Valyrian freehold. They may hold grudges against Daenerys, being that she's of the blood of Old Valyria, and their dragon is the way to counteract her three. Maybe they just want to fuck shit up in their own right. I don't know, and I don't want to don my tinfoil hat, so I won't go into deep speculation into this.\u000a\u000a--------------------------------------\u000a\u000a##4. Where Do We Go From Here?\u000a\u000aWe have a metric shitfuck of stories conglomerating in the Citadel with different threads. Sam is becoming a novice for the Wall. Jaqen has infiltrated the Citadel with a key that unlocks all rooms, looking for a book that will help the FM raise a dragon. Sarella Sand is there under the alias Arellas, training to become a maester as well. We don't know what she's up to, but as a Martell fan, I'm sure it'll be great.\u000a\u000aThe Maesters are trying to eliminate dragons and magic. The FM are trying to hatch a dragon egg. Marwyn is going against the Citadel to help Danaerys (who is being approached by a Red Priest named Moqorro, Victarion, Tyrion, Ser Jorah, and at war with Volantis, Yunkai, Qarth, and every other city in Essos, it seems). The Wall is maesterless for now, which might become significant as well.\u000a\u000aSo what happens?\u000a\u000aWell, in the first five books, the game of thrones has been focused mainly in King's Landing. Now, we will see a different sort of game played in Oldtown - the game of dragons. When you play the game of dragons, you win or you get scorched a la Quentyn. So, who wins and who gets scorched?\u000a\u000aWill the maesters, having control over most affairs in Westeros, be able to prevail over the Faceless Men, who can be anyone and kill anyone? Will Jaqen, Sarella, and Sam pose a problem towards the Citadel and the Archmaesters as they continue their own individual agendas? Will we learn more about what the maesters are up to?\u000a\u000aPersonally, I'm hoping for Harry Potter and the Winds of Winter. Watch as Samwell Tarly, a boy attending Hogwarts School of **NO** Witchcraft and Wizardry, as he embarks with his friends Sarella Sand and Pate "Pigboy" as they uncover the truths behind the Citadel. What's behind that door that Fluffy's guarding? Where is the Chamber of Secrets?\u000a\u000aOkay, I'm now making references to Harry Potter, which means my really long post is at an end. Personally, I think that the FM will hatch a dragon, but it will be killed by Drogon in Westeros. By the end, the Maesters will be nullified, and magic will run rampant once more. Oh, and Drogon and Viserion will have many many dragon babies together, because who else will they mate with? Rhaegal? Nah, he's such a bed hog.\u000a\u000a**TL;DR: Fuck it, just read the post. I spent hours on this shit.**\u000a\u000a##EDIT:\u000a\u000aI love your reactions to this. To be clear, I don't believe in Jaqen=Syrio or Jaqen=Ned, I just put them in there.\u000a\u000aSome people think that the FM are trying to kill dragons because they are Braavosi and hate anything related to Old Valyria, but I don't believe that. The FM have given up their identity. I think they want a dragon so that their magic can grow stronger. They will be better assassins and have more power. But that's just by speculation at this point.\u000a\u000aAlso, shoutout to /u/mheard, who just brought something else up. The maesters are working to exterminate magic by destroying the dragons, but that didn't stop the Others from waking from their thousand year slumber. And it didn't stop dragons from matching. Is it possible to extinguish magic? Had the maesters eliminated magic, or did they just tip the scale in the favor of ice over fire?\u000a\u000aC'mon, Georgie. We need the next book ASAP.

VA few paragraphs later, he strictly tells Sam to "say nothing of prophecies or dragons, unless you fancy poison in your porridge." This is the crux of the maester conspiracy. Marywn has admitted that the maesters killed the dragons for their magical connotations, and admitting that they are "building" their own world. This could, perhaps, also connect to the beginnings of Robert's Rebellion. They needed someone to overthrow the Targaryens, the most prolific reminder of the magic of Old Valyria. Instead they replace him with Andals and First Men.\u000a\u000aThis leads into my second point.\u000a\u000a--------------------------------------------\u000a\u000a##2. Maester Marywn the Mage**. Say that five times fast.\u000a\u000aOkay, so here's what we know of Marwyn. According to Sam's chapter, he has a thick neck and a strong jaw. He is short and squat with enormous hands, a thick chest and a hard ale-belly. He has white hair coming out of his nose and ears. His nose has been broken more than once and his teeth are stained red.\u000a\u000aHe spent eight years in the east. During this time, according to Mirri Maz Durr, he encountered her and taught her the secrets of the human body and the Common Tongue (AGOT Chapter 61, Daenerys VII). We know he knows some magic by this and the Valyrian steel tokens he carries (AFFC Appendix).\u000a\u000aMarwyn is also held in high esteem by Qyburn, a former maester, who told Jaime that of all the archmaesters, only Marwyn gave the idea of ghosts a thought (ASOS Chapter 44, Jaime VI). So far, we see him connected to Qyburn and Mirri Maz Durr, two people who know a form of necromancy/life-sustenance (Qyburn/Robert Strong and MMD/Drogo). Qyburn is thought of akin to a mad scientist, while MMD is just a crazy magic bitch. So far, he doesn't have very good associations.\u000a\u000aNow, something interesting from the Ice and Fire wiki.  [Cinnamon Wind](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Cinnamon_Wind), the ship which left Oldtown with Marwyn for Meereen, had already sailed to Qarth, met Dany, and then went off to the Jade Sea. I don't really know if it's significant, but I think it might mean something that he took a ship already mentioned. Or maybe it doesn't. Who knows?\u000a\u000aAs stated in the first section, Marwyn claims that the archmaesters have no more reason to trust him than Aemon Targaryen, giving the impression that his family makes him untrustworthy. As Lady Dustin said, Marwyn might be a bastard who wanted to shed the last name Hills or Flowers or Sand. Or maybe he's a son of a highborn lord. We aren't exactly sure. But how do family relationship have anything to do with the story?\u000a\u000aDustin mentioned that many maesters value family over duty in many situations, such as Maester Medrick or the acolyte Leo Tyrell. Marwyn has proven no hesitation towards helping Daenerys, which means he likely doesn't have a direct "beef" with the Targs. So he's not a Baratheon bastard or a Lannister guy. He is also unhappy with the status quo, of the Lannisters and Tyrells in power. A Lannister or Tyrell bastard wouldn't want to overthrow this regime if he is loyal to his family.\u000a\u000aHe may be Dornish, but we don't really get a description of his skin. We can't say if he is or isn't for sure, but I would say it's likely a no. Dornish have distinguishing characteristics, and having encountered a few people who have seen him, he's never mentioned as looking Dornish.\u000a\u000aI would say he is likely either a northman or a man of the Vale, possibly a Riverlands man. While they all fought against the Targs, they didn't have many reasons to vehemently hate them (well, maybe the northmen, but I feel like since Ned wasn't so pissed about it, his subjects might not be either). Is it a coincidence that these three lands are the most unloving of Lannisters and may welcome a Targaryen to fuck them up?\u000a\u000aEither way, it's likely a House or region which places much faith in magic. One could look to the North, where the Children of the Forrest practiced magic most recently. It's where direwolves find their way past the Wall, where unicorns exist (Skagos) and where the mysterious bogs are in the Neck. I feel like the magical connotations in the north are stronger than in any other place.\u000a\u000aI don't exactly know where this is going, because there are many possibilities. I've already gotten slightly tinfoily with these last few dissections, and I don't want to make broad shots in the dark. But it's pretty clear that he isn't trusted, and may be from "magical" lineage (please, no one say secret Targ. Jon, Tyrion, Jamie, Cersei, Varys, Daario, Benjen...it's enough already).\u000a\u000aSo far, it seems like Marwyn is the only person high up in the maester's organization that believes in magic. He has three people who are on his side at the citadel: Sam, Alleras, and Jaqen H'gar (masquerading as Pate...I'll get to that in the next section). That gives me a segue into the next section.\u000a\u000a----------------------------------------\u000a\u000a\u000a##3. Faceless Men\u000a\u000aAlright, let's start with Jaqen H'gar. From ACOK Chapter 47, Arya IX:\u000a\u000a&gt; "A god has his due. And now a man must die." A strange smile touched the lips of Jaqen H'gar.\u000a\u000a&gt; "Die?" she said, confused. What did he mean? "But I unsaid the name. You don't need to die now."\u000a\u000a&gt; I do. My time is done." Jaqen passed a hand down his face from forehead to chin, and where it went he changed. His cheeks grew fuller, his eyes closer; his nose hooked, a scar appeared on his right cheek where no scar had been before. And when he shook his head, his long straight hair, half red and half white, dissolved away to reveal a cap of tight black curls.\u000a\u000aNow, let's look at the AFFC prologue and see how Pate, the guy who hates being called the pig boy, describes the Alchemist, the man who offered a gold dragon (to be used to buy the virginity of the prettiest girl at the pub) in exchange for the set of archmaester's keys that unlocked every door in the Citadel:\u000a\u000a&gt; He was just a man, and his face was just a face. A young man's face, ordinary, with full cheeks and the shadow of a beard. A scar showed faintly on his right cheek. He had a hooked nose, and a mat of dense black hair that curled tightly around his ears. It was not a face Pate recognized.\u000a\u000aOf course, Pate's "death" at the end of the chapter is ambiguous, but when we see Pate again, he introduces him to Sam in the final words of the book:\u000a\u000a&gt; "I'm Pate," the other said, "like the pig boy."\u000a\u000aNow, what does this mean? Jaqen H'gar - if that is his real name - left the House of Black and White for a reason. He was in the black cells, which means that he was purposefully captured. There are two theories that I know of which speculate further on this.\u000a\u000aThe first, which I'm not sure if I believe, but I like, would be that Jaqen is Syrio. After he fought Meryn, he was captured and changed his face in the dungeon by the time Yoren picked the prisoners. I don't think it likely, just because taking time to train the Hand's daughter in needlework during a time of peace seems like a distraction from whatever mission he might have had.\u000a\u000aThe second, which I don't believe at all and is incredibly tin-foily is that Jaqen H'gar is really Ned Stark. As a Faceless Man, he took Ned's face while Varys helped him escape. Jaqen was really killed, while Varys had used his skill in changing appearance to help Ned look like Jaqen. It doesn't explain the face change at Harrenhal, nor why the Alchemist had the same description as Jaqen.\u000a\u000aHere's the odd part, though. Jaqen's mission wasn't originally to make it to Oldtown. He got captured and was on his way to the Wall. When that fell through due to war, he went down to the Citadel instead. What might the Citadel and the Wall have in common?\u000a\u000aI'll get to that in the next comment.\u000a\u000aEDIT: Grammar

VBeing a criminal doesn't mean you lose your rights. He took a Snickers bar, and for that he was assaulted sexually, humiliated, and physically attacked. What right did they have to do that? None.\u000a\u000aAgain, I don't think you understand. He committed what ends up being a minor misdemeanor, larceny of a good that equates to about $1.50 with tax. I'll even go $2.00 or so if it's a larger size. Whatever.\u000a\u000aIn return for this, he was **SEXUALLY ASSAULTED**, HUMILIATED, and ATTACKED. Multiple men were holding him, and one had his hands dangerously close to his barely-concealed penis. They committed felonious acts against a man who committed a misdemeanor.\u000a\u000aI don't understand why Reddit is upset that a man who was suspected (no trial or anything, no official confession) of a wrongdoing was attacked by above-necessary means, in a felonious fashion. What if there was a kid who was walking down the street suspiciously and the friendly neighborhood watchman thought he was up to no good. There was just as much proof for this kid doing wrong as for the shoplifter (I'll get to proof in a minute). So he calls out, and the kid starts running. The neighborhood watchman pursues and they get into an altercation. At this point it can be a misunderstanding.\u000a\u000aUntil George Zimmerman pulled the trigger.\u000a\u000aThese are very similar cases.\u000a\u000a1. **The person who committed the felony had no authority.** George Zimmerman was an unofficial neighborhood watchman who didn't have the right to commit a felonious act against Treyvon Martin based solely on suspicion. Likewise, the shop owners had no right to abuse this poor man. They have the right to detain him and call the police. No one called the police. They didn't have the right to strip him of his clothes. They didn't have the right to abuse him.\u000a\u000a2. **In America, the party charged with a crime is innocent until proven guilty in a trial by peers**. So far, all we have is that this guy had a Snickers in his pocket, and the store manager thought he was shoplifting. Did the store manager see him put it in his pocket from the shelf? We don't know, do we? Any admission of guilt he makes as he is assaulted by multiple men is made under duress, and thus not really admissible at all. If I was being attacked by a bunch of big guys, I'd say whatever they wanted to hear.\u000a\u000a3. **They took the law into their own hands.**  Kind of connects with #1. They didn't follow procedure. Yes, they detained him. But after detaining him, they stripped him and humiliated him (sexual assault). Just like if the manager or a security guard at a department store asks a woman to step into the office and wait for police because she is suspected of shoplifting, and once in that back office, she is beaten and raped, these men took a legal action taken to get justice and turned it into a sadistic and cruel act.\u000a\u000aI really don't understand what you're saying. I'm clinically insane because I think that a man who pickpocketed a $2.00 candy bar deserved to be sexually and physically assaulted and humiliated in public without regard to law? Well then, check me into that assylum because I actually **do** believe in following the law, regardless of who it defends.\u000a\u000aEDIT: I didn't even realized he was put in the walk-in-cooler without anything but boxers. Tell me that this is legal and the right thing to do? Really. What kind of fucked up world do you live in where you think it's okay to strip a man and put him in a freezer because he was going to steal a $2.00 candy bar. Hell, even if he was trying to steal a $300 dress from a clothing store or a $500 iPhone from an Apple Store, he doesn't deserve that. In addition to the mental trauma, think about how unhealthy that is. And how long did he have to be essentially naked in the freezer?

VI love how people are making jokes about this. I love a good joke as much as the rest of Reddit, but seriously, what they just did is illegal. They detain him and call the police. They don't strip search him. They don't assault him. They don't cause this kind of a scene. They took the law into their own hands. All people involved in hurting him, abusing him, stripping him (a sexual abuse) should be arrested and fined, and this man should sue 7/11.\u000a\u000aThere is no excuse. If this was a woman stripped to her bras and panties, women's rights activists would be all over this calling it abusive. Instead, I have to go dozens of comments down on this thread to see someone actually recognizing the fact that this is wrong. Stealing a candy bar was wrong too, but that doesn't justify being sexually and physically abused by the managers and workers there.\u000a\u000aI hope someone has a follow-up to this. I need to see that justice for this man was done.

We get to see some of the battle/negotiations that went into the fall, as well as seeing what Aegon is like from another POV than Tyrion and JonCon. The more POVs about our mystery king, the more we know about him.

VI think they're going to make her descent a little less sudden. She hasn't started killing in her own right yet, but she's shown three things.\u000a\u000a1. The willingness to at least be responsible for death. This is significant because it shows that even if she hasn't taken a life yet, she doesn't value human life over survival.\u000a\u000a2. Cunning and an ability to use resources well. She had plenty of options that she didn't take with her first two wishes (Tywin, for one), but when it came down to the third wish, she knew how to make it count. This leads into #3.\u000a\u000a3. An aptitude for manipulation. I probably wouldn't be able to think of a way to manipulate Jaqen into killing gate guards, and I'm in college. Somehow, this preteen managed to come up with a solid plan that involved a sort of bribery/blackmail and manipulation to further he needs.\u000a\u000aIn the next season, I see her story changing slightly from where it is now, but even moreso in Season 4. After the RW in Book 3, she has, like, two chapters until the end of the book. They'll pack more story in for her. Going from free to prisoner to the BWB and then prisoner to the Hound will harden her even more, and the loss of her brother and mother will be the final straw.\u000a\u000aI think they're waiting for her badass "first kill" moment to be when she recognizes Polliver, the man who took away Needle. Then, when she goes off to Braavos to become a Faceless (wo)Man, she will still end up with a sense of disregard for life. She will use the abilities she learns there to exact revenge on her enemies, just like she (hopefully) will in the books, and slowing down her grizzly descent into a heartless murderer will make her story all the stronger.

VYes. Aerys' line is descended from Viserys II Targaryen, brother of Aegon III (Aegon the Unlucky). I'm not 100% sure what happened during this era of the Dynasty, but the Martells of modern day are descended from Daenerys I, daughter of Aegon IV and granddaughter of Viserys II. The Blackfyres are descended from Aegon III. This means that the Martells are descended from one brother, and the Blackfyres from another.

VThe Baratheons are part of the Targaryen dynasty. Rob, Ren, and Stan all have dragon blood in them, being second or third cousins to Rhaegar/Viserys/Dany. They could have claimed right of conquest, but who had to? After Rhaegar, Aerys, Aegon and Rhaenys were killed and Viserys and Dany left the kingdoms, Robert was the legitimate heir of the Targaryen Dynasty.\u000a\u000aFollowing Robert, Stannis and Shireen come next, then Renly (except now he's dead). After that, the throne would have gone to Aemon (who is also dead by where we are in the series).\u000a\u000aThe next legitimate heir would be Doran Martell, who, through Daenerys I and Maron Martell, is the next successor. After Doran comes Arianne, then Quentyn, then Trystane. After them come the other brothers of Doran, Elia, and Oberyn: Mors and Olyvar. They were mentioned in one of the books, but I'm not sure whether they're alive or not.\u000a\u000aAfter them comes Oberyn, whose dead. Unless his daughters were legitimized, then they're not in the succession. If they are, the order is as follows: Obara, Nymeria, Tyene, Sarella, Elia, Obella, Dorea, Loreza. Lewyn Martell, Doran's uncle, comes next, but I believe he is dead or a maester or something, so is out of the succession.\u000a\u000aAfter the Baratheons and Martells come the Blackfyres. Here's where things get crazy. We don't have Blackfyre family tree, but we can assume it's quite extensive.\u000a\u000aThe role of women in this succession is unclear. With Princess Arianne and the Sand Sisters, the laws are clear because of Dornish laws. As to where Shireen and Daenerys stand in the succession, some argue that they come in where listed above (Dany comes after Viserys, Shireen after Stannis). Some argue that, as women, their place in succession falls after the Blackfyres.\u000a\u000aI would argue that they go where I put them, but if succession moved all the way down to the Martells, by Dornish law Danaerys and Shireen would become heirs before Arianne and the Sand Sisters.\u000a\u000a**TL;DR: Baratheons are part of Targ dynasty.

There are no blacks and whites, just like there aren't in real life.\u000a\u000aEven Orochimaru - who seems like someone who's evil for the sake of evil - isn't inherently evil. When he has flashbacks of helping Tsunade cope with Dan, there is some human in there. There was some human in there before his parents died, we are led to believe.\u000a\u000aSo far, there are only a few villains who cannot be sympathized with - Deidara, Hidan, and Kakuzu are a few that stick out in my mind. And it's no coincidence that they aren't anywhere near the best villains in the series.

Tsunade isn't exceptionally powerful, at least not more so than people like Kakashi, Gai, Naruto, etc.\u000a\u000aThe Third retired because he was old, and while Minato was young, he was a great candidate for Hokage. When Minato died, there weren't really people of Minato's caliber to take the mantle. All of our current adults were kids except for the Sannin. Tsunade was gambling, and Jiraya refused the offer.

Yeah, that was great, but still...not exactly qualifications for badassery.\u000a\u000a3) I don't remember the passage this was in, so based on different contexts, Tywin might have said it as a thanks to the Tyrells, even if the entire victory wasn't their doing. What was the context in which he said it?\u000a\u000a4) He had the power of the Vale, the North, and the Stormlands, with little exception. After the Tullys joined them, they had the Riverlands as well. Tywin holed himself up in Casterly Rock, too. It was Four great houses vs. Martells, Tyrells, and Targaryens.

That's really out of proportion, because no one would need so many people to guard just a few. I suggest you double-check those numbers.\u000a\u000a3) Not only is that *their* speculation (Tywin is a lot of things, but omnipotent isn't one), but even so, they mentioned that they would lose had they not shown up. They didn't attribute the victory to just the Tyrells, but acknowledged that they had a part to play in it.\u000a\u000a4) We don't know what would happen if Joff or Walder were defeated...as sad as it is to say, they never *have* been defeated. As for Jon Arryn, I wouldn't call him a badass just because he raised the rebellion. It was a fatherly act out of love and admiration for Robert and Ned, but it wasn't *badass*. When I think of badass, I don't just think of "cool" or "awesome," but of "WHAT THE HOLY MOTHERFUCK?" I don't think Jon Arryn standing up for his foster children, standing up to an unloved king with the strength of half the realm was on the "WHAT THE HOLY MOTHERFUCK?" level.

Stannis wasn't stopping them.\u000a\u000a3) He had no strategy to defend the back of his attack. And with Tywin at Harrenhal, he should have had scouts around Kings Landing to report if they saw armies. It wasn't completely unexpected that at the very least Tywin would reinforce his grandson.\u000a\u000a4) His men have absolute loyalty to him? So did most other Kings.

He led an attack on Pyke under Robert, and he didn't really do anything impressive during Robert's rebellion except for holing up in Storm's End and surviving until Davos came along. As for this war, his only victory so far has been against a host of untrained, undisciplined wildlings. I'm not exactly sure why people consider him a great battle commander.

VThis was way back before the war started. He based his opinion on Stannis based on two things:\u000a\u000a1. Stannis was a war hero from Robert's Rebellion and Balon's Rebellion.\u000a\u000a2. If the incest became widely-known and believed, Stannis would have the claim.\u000a\u000aBut no one flocked to Stannis when he crowned himself. In fact, he was the only king without a strong support system. Balon had the Iron Islanders, Robb was not only supported by Riverlands and North, but was the only one crowned by his people instead of himself, Renly was loved by the Stormlands and the Reach. Even Joffrey was supported by the Westerlands.\u000a\u000aStannis managed to get his power after killing a more favored contender, and only posed a threat then. The threat was short lived after he was defeated. His fleet was crushed, most of his followers went back to Joffrey with tails between their legs, and Stannis had to retreat to Dragonstone.\u000a\u000aExcept in the very beginning when the *idea* of someone else claiming the crown was a scary thought and in the short time between Renly's death and the Battle of the Blackwater, no one feared Stannis.

VKakashi has two things going for him: Sharingan and Chidori. I'll even throw summoning in there. Sasuke is a natural Sharignan-user, and he seemed to be able to pick up how to use it effectively on his own. He was also able to enhance his chidori on his own. And I would say that snake summons are more useful than dogs, but that's down to personal opinion. But what else does Kakashi have to offer, really?\u000a\u000aOrochimaru had a litany of jutsus at his disposal. He helped Sasuke master the curse mark, and helped him use that sword that he had for most of Shippuden. [He](http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Binding_Snake_Glare_Spell) [learned](http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Body_Flame_Technique) [all](http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Body_Shedding) [these](http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Hidden_Shadow_Snake_Hands) jutsus, while also learning how to use genjutsu. His progress was enhanced with drugs, which wouldn't have happened in Konoha.\u000a\u000aCompare that to Naruto, who was off "training" with Jiraya. What did he learn? A bigger Rasengan? For two years training? Sasuke completely outclassed him.\u000a\u000aSince leaving Orochimaru, Sasuke has learned nothing new. He's used Kirin, but it was [implied he already knew that while he was with Orochimaru](http://www.mangahere.com/manga/naruto/v34/c309/13.html). In fact, the *only* thing he's improved on has been gaining the Mangekyo Sharingan (and a hawk summoning, but he only used that once vs. Danzo). Could you imagine if he awakened the MS under Oro's guidance? He'd be much more powerful than he is now, that I'll bet on.

She despised him because he was always there, a constant reminder. I don't think any rational person made to walk a mile in her shoes would be able to say they wouldn't resent this walking slap-in-the-face.

VHonestly, I don't even blame her for that. Not only was Ned bringing Jon Snow to live with them a slap in the face (remember how bastards are seen in the story; and just the thought of there being someone out there special enough to make Ned FUCKING Stark forget his honor) in many ways, but she was also out of her mind with grief.\u000a\u000a**Look at this through her POV, and keep in mind her upbringing: FAMILY, DUTY, HONOR**\u000a\u000aHer sister tells her that her brother-in-law, Ned's foster father for all intents and purposes, was murdered, but then, her husband is prepared to take all their children but their youngest and their oldest down to the capital, where these murderers live. She prays for them to not take her boy Bran away, and as a "careful what you wish for" twist, Bran is now possibly going to die.\u000a\u000aThen, at the height of her mourning, blaming herself for praying to her gods to keep Bran at home, this walking slap-in-the-face who was raised like a trueborn Stark comes walking in like it's his business. It's none of his business. He shouldn't have even been in the North. By all rights, he should be in the south with whomever his mother is, like the bastard he is. The walking slap-in-the-face is the last thing she needs while worrying about her family and blaming herself for her son's possible death.\u000a\u000aLet's take it a step further. When her daughters and her husband head south with these accused murderers and backstabbers, a man is sent to **OPEN HER SON'S THROAT.** If he didn't have a direwolf, **BRAN WOULD HAVE DIED**, and so would she. But no, they both survived. Family, Duty, Honor. It was her *duty* to protect her children (*family*), so she went down south to tell Ned of the attack. He needed to know.\u000a\u000aWhile there, she finds out that a man - one of the people accused of killing her brother-in-law - was the owner of the dagger used by the man sent to kill her son. Family, Duty, Honor. Her family has been targeted by this man and his family twice now. But whatever, let Ned handle it. She goes up the Kingsroad, staying incognito so that these *dangerous* people don't find out that she's on to them.\u000a\u000aThen, wouldn't you know it, that same man who is accused of killing her brother-in-law and attempting to kill her son **SEES HER ON HER TRAVELS**. If they know that she's this far south, they'll know something is up. Tyrion will know that she is on to him, and there's no man so dangerous as this Imp, as far as she knows. Surrounded by people loyal to her family, she has Tyrion abducted and taken to the safest place around - the Eyrie - so he can answer for his crimes.\u000a\u000aShe enlists the help of a sellsword who betrays her. This dangerous man is set loose - there has been nothing, so far, to indicate that he **wasn't** the one who did all this. But she leaves - she must. She's overstayed her welcome. She and her sole bodyguard have to walk through the dangerous pass to get to the riverlands. While there, she finds out that **HER HUSBAND WAS TAKEN BY THIS FAMILY. HER DAUGHTERS ARE CAPTIVE AS WELL!!**\u000a\u000aFamily, duty, honor. She finds her son, who has raised a large host. He needs her to negotiate a way through the Twins. She needs to save her husband and do her duty to her son, the Lord of Winterfell. Family, Duty, Honor. She makes this deal, and helps her son move his army south to save her husband. Meanwhile, the Lannisters attack Riverrun and capture Edmure Tully, her brother.\u000a\u000aBut she can't help him, in the end. Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell, her husband, the love of her life and father of her children, was killed by this family. This family is ravaging her homeland, and has taken her eldest daughter as hostage. (No word on her younger one, who knows where she is? The only family that is safe right now is Rickon and Bran.) Then, the Imp, the man who was sent to open her son's throat and helped kill Jon Arryn, **IS MADE THE HAND OF THE KING**! Lannisters everywhere.\u000a\u000aHer son battles the enemy and snags a few victories. But he's not safe. No matter how many Lannisters they capture or how many victories they win, Tywin has a large host, and Joffrey has her Sansa. When King Robb sends Theon Greyjoy to Pyke to create an alliance, **she advises against it**. Theon Greyjoy is not trustworthy. She knows it; why can't Robb see it? When King Robb asks his mother to go down and arrange a peace for him with Renly, she goes. She needs to do this to help their victory, save her family, and do her duty to her king.\u000a\u000aRenly is killed in front of her, so she helps the innocent girl who loved him. She takes her on as a sidekick, for lack of a better word. She goes up north to her son once more, and finds out that she was right - Theon Greyjoy wasn't trustworthy. He captured their home. Now Sansa is in Lannister hands, Bran and Rickon are Theon's captives, only the gods know where Arya is, and Robb is at war and could die any day. Her lord father is sick and dying, and she is cut off from her home. Their only hope is to fight enemies on two sides, win, and hope that they don't lose their family in the process.\u000a\u000aThen, her son marches west into the heart of Lannister territory. She finds out that Bran and Rickon were killed by Theon. **WHY DIDN'T ROBB LISTEN TO HER!?** She now only has three children left to her. One she knows is in Lannister hands, the other may or may not be, and the third is on the front lines of war. The only chance she has of her children being returned to her is to release the Kingslayer. **FAMILY**, Duty, Honor.\u000a\u000aShe is imprisoned for this act of family. Her brother won't speak to her, her father is dying, her uncle and son are off at war. Sansa and Arya are both still gone. She was brought up to value family above all else, even more than duty and honor. But what family does she have left? What family *will* she have left when this is finished?\u000a\u000aHer son comes back and she finds out that he has married a girl. She seems nice, but this action is a betrayal against a prickly lord. A lord they need. Her brother is still angry at her, and her son tells her that after Edmure's wedding, she will be kept safe at Seagard. Pfft. She knows what this is. She knows this is to keep her out of his hair. She's failed her family, her duty, and her honor. She's lost almost everything.\u000a\u000aHer daughter is married to the Imp. Yes, the same Imp who tried to kill Bran. The same Imp who killed Jon Arryn. The same Imp who took Ned's place as Hand after Ned was assassinated. He's brother to the queen and the Kingslayer, uncle to King Joffrey who chopped her husband's head off. They held her daughter as hostage and then married her - a delicate girl who still had rose-colored glasses - to a monstrous, murdering, evil, twisted, Imp.\u000a\u000aThen, her son is ready to make that bastard, that walking slap-in-the-face, his ***HEIR***!?!?!?!?!?!?!? Everyone knows bastards are abominations. They can't be trusted. They're evil down to their very souls. And Robb is willing to let this bastard call himself Stark and be the patriarch of the family, the next King in the North? He didn't listen to her about Theon and look what happened. He has to listen about this.\u000a\u000aHe doesn't.\u000a\u000aThen she does lose everything. Walder **FUCKING** Frey kills her son. Who knows what happened to her brother? Sansa and Arya may never see her again, and Brynden is holed up in Riverrun. Her sister hasn't even made an attempt to help them during all their trials and tribulations. She doesn't have anything left.\u000a\u000aShe wakes up. She was dead, but now she's not. Arya is almost certainly gone. Sansa is fled the capital, missing, if new has reached her. If not, she's still captive of her husband the Imp. Her Ned is gone, her brother is captive, her uncle is under siege, her sister is still sitting high on her chair in the Eyrie. Robb is dead. Bran is dead. Rickon is dead. Hoster is dead. What does she have left?\u000a\u000aVengence. Justice. Fire and blood.\u000a\u000aWell, not in the same way as the Martells and Targaryens. But of her own sort. Her heart has turned to stone. She has nothing left, not even her voice. All she has left is vengence. So she kills one Frey. And then another. She brings her cold, hard vengence upon all those who have wronged her and her family. Fuck honor and fuck duty. Her family was #1, and her family was destroyed.\u000a\u000aThen, wouldn't you know, Brienne of Tarth shows her ugly little head again. Brienne made a vow to her that she would obey her. When Brienne went off with Jamie, she stopped being loyal to Catelyn. Brienne made allegience with Jamie, and was waving around a signed paper looking for a missing Sansa. Why would Jamie **LANNISTER** want her daughter, if not to kill her or force her to stay married to the monstrous Imp? And Brienne, who swore a vow to the Seven, is ***HELPING HIM***!?!?!? The only conclusion is that she is going to bring even more horrors upon her only child left to her.\u000a\u000aIt is time for Brienne to choose. Will she be Lady Catelyn's woman, now and always, as she swore, or will she be another Frey, just looking to survive and betray her family and oaths in doing so? Will she help Catelyn bring vengence to the enemies of Houses Stark and Tully, or will she choose the Lannisters after all? Sword or Noose?\u000a\u000a**END**\u000a\u000aLook, all I'm saying is that looking at the way she was brought up, the world she lived in, and the things that happened to her, I see Catelyn as one of the strongest characters in the books, and I really do love her, even if her POVs were sometimes boring.

VI still don't think he's the best guy to sit the Iron Throne. He's a hard man who is unloveable by most. He comes in, uprooting houses like the Lannisters and the Targaryens (Aegon, Dany) and their allies (Martells, Tyrells). Then what? He's turned the entire political system upside down. Either he replaces these houses with his friends, or he allows ambitious houses from within each land to take up the mantle. Neither is good for the realm's stability.\u000a\u000aThen there are the smallfolk. They love the Seven, so why would they ever follow a Red King? If Stannis puts his loyal friends in positions of power (like he did with Davos; imagine the Florents as the seat of the Reach), they will, likely, follow the Red God. They won't get support from peasants.\u000a\u000aLastly, what happens when rebellion happens? Stannis rules with an iron fist. It might be just, but it's no less hard. When a lord decides he has the money, power, and allies to risk a rebellion, people will flock to him. People will remember the old days when even Lord Balon rebelling was treated with ease. Balon kept his seat in Pyke. But now, people are being sent to the Wall or put to the sword for what they consider to be minor crimes. Think about Jorah Mormont's situation, only more severe and widespread.\u000a\u000aWhen Dany comes with Dragons and thousands of followers who call her "Mother" and can't bear to be parted from her, with armies of loyal Dothraki followers (should she beat the khals and take their khalasaars as the end of ADWD suggested) who perceive her as some great warrior, people will flock to her. People will say, "look at this girl, Queen of Meereen, who treats her subjects as children. We would rather have her than this man who would send a man to the Wall for killing a bastard whore."\u000a\u000aWhen Lannister, Martell and Tyrell remnants (if any remain after Stannis takes power) decide they'd rather join Danaerys than stay the equivalent of second-class lords in Stannis' kingdom, they will lend credence to her rule. When she lands and brings Fire and Blood to the ironborn who have been ravaging the Reach and the North alike, she will gain their support. When she takes out Stannis, the man who would not bend, only the Florents and the Onion Knight will mourn.\u000a\u000aWhen she brings back the Faith of the Seven, the people will rejoice. The High Septon will be more than happy to bless Danaerys as the rightful Queen of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. Her dragons will be just as awe-inspiring in Westeros as in Essos - A TARGARYEN MONARCH WITH DRAGONS! People will assume that she' taking them back to the era of Aegon the Conqueror rather than Aerys the Mad.\u000a\u000aShe'd be a good queen, too, I think. A lot of her hate comes from her inner monologue about Daario, being so much like a teenage girl. But when she sits down and rules, she's shown to be good at it. She puts Daario aside to marry Harzoo for the good of her city, despite not wanting it. She knows how to sacrifice for rule.\u000a\u000aNot only that, but she's more compassionate than Stannis is by leaps and bounds. Stannis will look at law. Danaerys will look at what's right. I could see sweeping reform throughout Westeros, especially in the area of women's rights. Will daughters have a say in who they marry? Will the Dornish Law of a woman's place in the line of succession be applied to the rest of the realm? Will women like Brienne get a chance to be anointed knights and great ladies without the need of having a husband?\u000a\u000aStannis won't give that. All Stannis will give is his hard justice.

VA meme is "an idea, behavior or style that spreads from person to person within a culture." A meme acts as a unit for carrying cultural ideas, symbols or practices, which can be transmitted from one mind to another through writing, speech, gestures, rituals or other imitable phenomena.\u000a\u000aAn example of a meme would be Overly Attached Girlfriend. You can see references and examples of OAG without the need of it's image macro.\u000a\u000aThe image macro of Overly Attached Girlfriend is the picture of her with buggy eyes looking at the camera (taken from her Justin Bieber "Boyfriend" parody on YouTube).\u000a\u000aSometimes, as in the case of OAG, the terms 'image macro' and 'meme' can be used interchangeably. However, not all memes have image macros, and not all image macros have memes.\u000a\u000aFor instance, the OP's image macro here is not a meme. It isn't a funny idea that spreads, it is just a picture with text. No one would understand what I am saying if I talked about the "hairy wizard" meme, but they would understand if I told someone "I saw an image macro in which Harry responded to Hagrid's famous 'You're a wizard, Harry' with 'You're a hairy wizard'."\u000a\u000aLikewise, as I mentioned, not all memes have image macros. A good example of this is [planking](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/planking). Other examples include  [taking an arrow to the knee](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-took-an-arrow-in-the-knee), [Chuck Testa](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/nope-chuck-testa), and [Nyan Cat](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/nyan-cat-pop-tart-cat). These all have one thing in common: People know what they are (meme) but aren't necessarily spread through image macros (like Arrow to the Knee can be spread through the comment "and then I took an arrow to the knee" instead of having to post an image like [this](http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/209/627/11742551.jpg).

VI always found it weird that Stannis gets a ton of credit for abandoning his fight with the Lannisters to defend his people. Stannis was more than happy to just let the wall fester. Davos had to bring the letter back to him and convince him that he was obligated to do that. Otherwise, Stannis would have just kinslew and tried to make dragons with his priestess.\u000a\u000aAnytime Stannis does something good, it's almost always because Davos told him.

VYou have to have the whole passage:\u000a\u000aThe arguing raged on late into the night. Each lord had a right to speak, and speak they did...and shout, and cruse, and reason, and cajole, and jest, and bargain, and slam tankards on the table, and threaten, and walk out, and return sullen or smiling. Catelyn sat and listened to it all.\u000a\u000aRoose Bolton had re-formed the battered remnants of their other host at the mouth of the causeway. Ser Helman Tallhart and Walder Frey still held the Twins. Lord Tywin's army had crossed the Trident and was making for Harrenhal. And there were two kings in the realm. Two kings, and no agreement.\u000a\u000aMany of the lords bannermen wanted to march on Harrenhal at once, to meet Lord Tywin and end Lannister power for all time. Young, hot-tempered Marq Piper urged a strike west at Casterly Rock instead. Still others counseled patience. Riverrun sat athwart the Lannister supply lines, Jason Mallister pointed out; let them bide their time, denying Lord Tywin fresh levies and provisions while they strengthened their defenses and rested their weary troops.\u000a\u000aLord Blackwood would have none of it. They should finish the work they began in the Whispering Wood. March to Harrenhal and bring Roose Bolton's army down as well. What Blackwood urged, Bracken opposed, as ever; Lord Jonos Bracken rose to insist they ought to pledge their fealty to King Renly, and move south to join their might to his.\u000a\u000a"Renly is not kind," Robb said. It was the first time her son had spoken. Like his father, he knew how to listen.\u000a\u000a"You cannot mean to hold to Joffrey, my lord," Galbart Glover said. "He put your father to the death."\u000a\u000a"That makes him evil," Robb replied. "I do not know that it makes Renly king. Joffrey is still Robert's eldest trueborn son, so the throne is rightfully his by all the laws of the realm. Were he to die, and I mean to see that he does, he has a younger brother. Tommen is next in line after Joffrey."\u000a\u000a"Tommen is no less Lannister," Ser Marq Piper snapped.\u000a\u000a"As you say," said Robb, troubled. "Yet if neither one is king, still, how could it be Lord Renly? He is Robert's *younger* brother. Bran can't be Lord of Winterfell befrore me, and Renly can't be king before Stannis."\u000a\u000aLady Mormont agreed. "Lord Stannis has the better claim."\u000a\u000a"Renly is *crowned*," said Marq Piper. "Highgarden and Storm's End support his claim, and the Dornishmen will not be laggardly. If Winterfell and Riverrun add their strength to his, he will have five of the seven great houses behind him. Six, if the Arryns bestir themselves! Six against the Rock! My lords, within the year, we will have all their heads on pikes, the queen and the boy king, Lord Tywin, the Imp, the Kingslayer, Ser Kevan, *all* of them! That is what we shall win if we join with King Renly. What does Lord Stannis have against that, that we should cast it all aside?"\u000a\u000a"The right," said Robb stubbornly. Catelyn thought he sounded eerily like his father as he said it.\u000a\u000a"So you mean to declare for Stannis?" asked Edmure.\u000a\u000a"I don't know," said Robb. "I prayed to know what to do, but the gods did not answer. The Lannisters killed my father for a traitor, and we know that was a lie, but if Joffrey is the lawful king and we fight against him, we *will* be traitors."\u000a\u000a"My lord father would urge caution," aged Ser Stevron said, with the weaselly smile of a Frey. "Wait, let these two kings play their game of thrones. When they are done fighting, we can bend our knees to the victor, or oppose him, as we choose. With Renly arming, likely Lord Tywin would welcome a truce...and the safe return of his son. Noble lords, allow me to go to him at Harrenhgal and arrange good terms and ransoms..."\u000a\u000aA roar of outrage drowned out his voice. "*Craven*!" the Greatjon thundered. "Begging for a truce will make us seem weak," declared Lady Mormont. "Ransoms be damned, we must not give up the Kingslayer," shouted Rickard Karstark.\u000a\u000a"Why not a peace?" Catelyn asked.\u000a\u000aThe lords looked at her, but it was Robb's eyes she felt, his and his alone. "My lady, they murdered my lord father, your husband," he said grimly. He unsheathed his longsword and laid it on the table before him, the bright steel on the rough wood. "This is the only peace I have for Lannisters."\u000a\u000aThe Greatjon bellowed his approval, and the other men added their voices, shouting and drawing swords and pounding their fists on the table. Catelyn waited until they had quieted.\u000a\u000a"My lords," she said then, "Lord Eddard was your liege, but I shared his bed and bore his children. Do you think I love him any less than you?" Her voice almost broke with her grief, but Catelyn took a long breath and steadied herself. "Robb, if that sword could bring him back, I should never let you sheathe it until Ned stood at my side once more...but he is gone, and a hundred Whispering Woods will not change that. Ned is gone, and Daryn Hornwood, and Lord Karstark's valiant sons, and many other good men besides, and none of them will return to us. Must we have more deaths still?"\u000a\u000a"You are a woman, my lady," the Greatjon rumbled in his deep voice. "Women do not understand these things."\u000a\u000a"You are of the gentler sex," said Lord Karstark, with the lines of grief fresh on his face. "A man has a need for vengance."\u000a\u000a"Give me Cersei Lannister, Lord Karstark, and you would see how *gentle* a woman can be," Catelyn replied. "Perhaps I do not understand tactics and strategy...but I understand futility. We went to war when Lannister armies were ravaging the riverlands, and Ned was a prisoner falsely accused of treason. We fought to free ourselves, and to win my lord's freedom.\u000a\u000a"Well, the one is done, and the other forever beyond our reach. I will mourn for Ned until the end of my days, but I must think of the living. I want my daughters back, and the queen holds them still. If I must trade our four Lannisters for their two Starks, I will call that a bargain and thank the gods. I want you safe, Robb, ruling at Winterfell from your father's seat. I want you to live your life, to kiss a girl and wed a woman and father a son. I want to write an end to this. I want to go home, my lords, and weep for my husband."\u000a\u000aThe hall was very quiet when Catelyn finished speaking.\u000a\u000a"Peace," said her uncle Brynden. "Peace is sweet my lady...but on what terms? It is no good hammering your sword into a plowshare if you must forge it again on the morrow."\u000a\u000a"What did Torrhen and my Eddard die for, if I am to return to Karhold with nothing but bones?" asked Rickard Karstark.\u000a\u000a"Aye," said Lord Bracken. "Gregor Clegan laid waste to my fields, slaughtered my smallfolk, and left Stone Hedge a smoking ruin. Am I now to bend the knee to the ones who sent him? What have we fought for, if we are to put ll back as it was before?" Lord Blackwood agreed, to Catelyn's surprise and dismay. "And if we do make peace with King Joffrey, are we not then traitors to King Renly? What if the stag should prevail against the lion, where would that leave us?"\u000a\u000a"Whatever you may decide for yourselves, I shall never call a Lannister my king," declared Marq Piper.\u000a\u000a"Nor I!" yelled the little Darry boy. "I never will!" Again, the shouting began. Cately sat despairing. She had come so close, she thought.\u000a\u000aThey had almostl istened, *almost*...but the moment was gone. There would be no peace, no chance the heal, no safety. She looked at her son, watched him as he listened to the lords debate, frowning, troubled, yet wedded to his war. He had pledged himself to marry a daughter of Walder Frey, but she saw his true bride plain before her now: the sword he had laid on the table.\u000a\u000aCatelyn was thinking of her girls, wondering if she would ever see them again, when the Greatjon lurched to his feet.\u000a\u000a**HERE IT COMES**\u000a\u000a"*MY LORDS*!" he shouted, his voice booming off the rafters. "Here is what I say to these two kings!" He spat. "Renly Baratheon is nothing to me, nor Stannis neither. Why should they rule over me and mine, from some flowery seat in Highgarden and Dorne?\u000a\u000a"What do they know of the Wall or the wolfswood or the barrows of the First Men? Even their gods are wrong. The Others take the Lannisters too, I've had a bellyful of them." He reached back over his shoulder and drew his immense two-handed greatsword. "Why shouldn't we rule ourselves again? It was the dragons we married, and the dragons are all dead!" He pointed at Robb with his blade. "*There* sits the only king I mean to bend *my* knee to, m'lords," he thundered. "The King in the North!" And he knelt, and laid his sword at her son's feet.\u000a\u000a"I'll have peace on those terms," Lord Karstark said. "They can keep their red castle, and their iron chair as well." He eased his longsword from its scabbard. "The King in the North!" he said, kneeling beside the Greatjon.\u000a\u000aMaege Mormont stood. "The King of Winter!" she declared, and laid her spiked mace beside the swords. \u000a\u000aAnd the river lords were rising too, Blackwood and Bracken and Mallister, houses who had never been ruled from Winterfell, yet Catelyn watched them rise and draw their blades, bending their knees  and shouting the old words that had not been heard in the realm for more than three hundred years, since Aegon the Dragon had come to make the Seven Kingdomes one...yet now were heard again, rising from the timbers of her father's hall.\u000a\u000a**"The King in the North!"**\u000a\u000a**"The King in the North!"**\u000a\u000a**"The King in the North!"**

They aren't allowed to check the 'African-American' box on surveys, etc. that ask about race.

Kakashi wouldn't be sad killing a Zetsu clone, even if it looked like Rin. If Rin already died in the battle, Kakashi would know that whoever his hand is stuck inside of now isn't the real Rin.\u000a\u000aMy theory is that Rin is a plant from Root that was supposed to keep an eye on Kakashi, a known genius, and Minato, Oro and Danzo's competition for Fourth Hokage. Like Sai, she has no personality except 'I'm a good girl,' has no family to speak of, and is a completely unknown entity. She's also way too familiar with eye transplants for a girl her age.\u000a\u000aThat's not to say that Madara didn't know about it. In fact, I almost expect Madara to have some 'in' in the village and know about Rin. He might have even set it up so that Kakashi found out in time for Obito to show up and see him kill Rin.

VIn regard to the stag and the wolf, I assumed that it meant that their involvement with each other would lead to the decline of their houses, which is true regardless of Ned's death. Robb is dead. Bran and Rickon are presumed dead and on the run. Arya is off forgetting who she is in Braavos. Sansa has become Alayne Stone in the Vale. Jon may or may not be dead. Benjen is missing. Even Cat, if we want to include her, is a half-dead monster by now. Meanwhile, on the Baratheons, Robert is dead, Renly is dead, and Stannis is in a very precarious situation when it comes to his fight. If he loses, which he very well might, he's as good as dead. That's not to say that neither family will return to prominence/power, but for now, the Stark/Baratheon involvement with each other has led to the decline of both houses.\u000a\u000aAs for the Red Wedding, I think that GRRM's attention to detail kind of proves my point. By the time we learn of Grey Wind's head being sewn onto Robb's body, we already saw the RW. People weren't dismembered. The food wasn't the same. The crown is completely different from the crown Robb wore. There is no reason for him to change those things for the HotU vision unless it was significant. It might be a false foreshadowing, meant to trick readers into thinking that it has been fulfilled.

Not only doesn't he have any means to tell the future or read prophecy, but 'bloody' is used quite frequently in the book to mean 'fucking.'

VA montage over the Rains of Castamere. Robb is killed. Catelyn is killed. We watch as battle erupts in the camps. We see drunk men slaughtered. We see brave men captured. We see fires. We see death. We see destruction. We go back inside the Twins as the Greatjon is subdued, and we see Walder Frey with a satisfied smirk on his face. Then, we see Catelyn's body chucked naked into the water, right before we see them place a crown on GreyRobb. Our last scene is Sandor chasing Arya with an axe. She looks behind her, and bam...\u000a\u000aGreg Spence.

VThey shouldn't do this all out of order. A big factor in the Purple Wedding is the feeling of victory.\u000a\u000a[ASOS](/b "Tywin, Joffrey, and Cersei are happiest, knowing that Stannis, Robb, and Renly are all irrelevant and the Greyjoys are soon on their way out. Meanwhile, Sansa is depressed and taken to the Eyrie by Littlefinger because her only family left is dead and Lysa is the only person left to take her in.")\u000a\u000aMoving the sequence of events all around deeply compromises the stories. Remember when the show [ACOK/Season 2](/b "didn't include the fact that Catelyn knew of Bran/Rickon's "deaths" before releaing Jamie?") That didn't go over too well.

If you want to make it close to canon, then it's a pretty bad idea to start with couples that seem like a stretch.\u000a\u000aAs for survivors, Sasuke is kind of up in the air at this point. He will probably turn to the good side, but he still might die. I'm placing my bet on Tsunade dying, and it doesn't look too good for Gai either. I don't think Kakashi will die, nor do I think Lee will.

VA part of me wants Kakashi to save Obito, but I've always wanted Tobi to die for what he believes in. He was always portrayed like the person who doesn't care what you have to say because he knows what he's doing and you can't change his mind. If Kakashi does change his mind, it'll feel incredibly cheap to me. After all his talk he was still just another easily-influenced bad guy.

VThese fillers have been good, though. I've never liked fillers, but I always watch because I don't have a life.\u000a\u000aLast week's episode and this week's episode were both about [Anime](/a "The Night when Zetsu infiltrates the Shinobi forces.") Specifially, last week focused on [279](/a "Kiba/Hinata/Shino, trying to figure out which of the other two are Zetsu impersonators after a cave-in.") This week's, which was even better, in my opinion, was about [280](/a "Deidara escaping the seal with Zetsu's help and wreaking havoc on the samurai/shinobi division. Obviously he needs to get sealed up by the end again, but it was fun to watch.")\u000a\u000aWhat's really awful is when the filler has nothing to do with the story, like with the Adventures at Sea Arc or the Konoha History Arc. These filler episodes are more like vignettes to fill in the pieces of the war that Kishi skipped over in the manga. We didn't really see the wide-reaching effects of Zetsu's rampage, just the beginning and end of it.\u000a\u000aPersonally, I wished they would have expanded on the battles. Have more than just one episode about Kakashi's division vs. the Ninja Swordsmen. We never really got to see all of them sealed, and those were seven people that I have wanted to see fight since we met Zabuza.\u000a\u000a**TL;DR: These fillers are good, for once. It's worth the twenty minutes out of your week to watch them.**

VJust posted this somewhere else:\u000a\u000aSasuke will go to Konoha on his quest to find the ones who know everything (who I believe are the village elders), and while there, he will read the Uchiha scrolls with his new EMS. He will learn how to activate the Rinnegan, and Orochimaru will help him implant Hashirama's DNA (because his main goal is to take Sasuke's body, and Sasuke is much more useful with a Rinnegan).\u000a\u000aThat's how Madara will be taken down: Sasuke will have the ultimate eye technique, the Uchiha's Rinnegan, while Naruto will have the power of the Bijuu. The entire series has been about the "two sons of the SotSP," the Uchiha who inherited his eyes and the Senju who inherited his will and spirit. Naruto and Sasuke will work together, and their combination will theoretically create the Sage of Six Paths - the only power that can defeat Madara.\u000a\u000aI think that before the final battle between Sasuke/Naruto and Madara, some shit's going to have to go down away from the war. Here's how I see it being played out:\u000a\u000aKakashi and Gai battle Obito as Madara takes on Naruto. Gai ends up using his Eighth Gate "to protect someone precious," as he urged Lee to do. Gai will be able to severely hurt Obito, but not kill him. Gai's death (from opening the Eighth Gate) will push Kakashi into fighting with his all. I think Kakashi will end up being able to kill Obito. Kakashi might try to change his mind, but Tobi has been portrayed sort of like 'the man who can't be moved,' so I think he'll have to die when push comes to shove.\u000a\u000aWith the Allied Forces arriving, his ally defeated, and the Four Kage (save Tsunade who died to revive them) back on the scene, Madara realizes his last chance is the Juubi. He has already killed B and sealed the Hachibi into the Gedo (sad, but it has to happen). Somehow, the Allied Shinobi Forces are able to stop the Gedo from transforming temporarily, and Madara is forced to retreat until it's ready.\u000a\u000aThis is when Naruto vs. Sasuke happens. Konoha picks Kakashi to be the Sixth Hokage (Naruto just isn't ready to waste the rest of his life sitting behind a desk, and Kakashi has just done the hardest thing in his entire life; he's earned a retirement from routine active combat). Naruto is able to bring Sasuke to the light after learning what he learns from the elders and considering Itachi's sacrifice.\u000a\u000aNow we have to deal with Orochimaru. Madara and the Juubi are the final villains. I think that during Sasuke &amp; Naruto vs. Madara, Big M will release the Juubi but will be killed/defeated before he is able to activate the Eye of the Moon plan.\u000a\u000aNaruto, Sasuke, and a few other powerful shinobi all try to stop the Juubi from destroying the world, but it's not working. This whole time, earthquakes are happening all over, volcanos are erupting. Shits getting real. Finally, they are left with only one option: to seal the Ten-Tails.\u000a\u000aThe Ten-Tails jinchuriki must have immense chakra reserves. He or she would have to be able to contain it. And there is only one person we know of. They somehow combine Kyuubi into the Ten-Tails and then seal the big thing into Naruto.\u000a\u000aDuring the sealing process, however, [this guy](http://imgur.com/QfhE7) knocks into Sasuke, who falls on top of Naruto and they kiss.\u000aEveryone is shocked.\u000aSpaghetti falls out of Naruto's pocket.\u000aEverybody walk the dinosaur.\u000a\u000aThe End.

VI think the thing that stood out to me in this page was the way that Tobi talks about using Sasuke instead of Nagato. Nagato's only role was to use his Rinnegan to revive Madara (the "for me" in this chapter meaning "for my purposes," not necessarily "to revive me"). If Tobi wanted to use Sasuke to revive Madara, then he's probably been pushing Sasuke to awaken the Rinnegan (we can deduce this since we now know the evolution from Sharingan ---&gt; Mangekyo ---&gt; Eternal Mangekyo ---&gt; Rinnegan).\u000a\u000aIt's why Tobi started showing an interest in Sasuke after Nagato died. It's why Tobi made sure to keep Itachi's eyes (so that he could transplant them and give Sasuke EMS...not for Sasuke's own benefit, but for his own). It's also why Tobi wanted Sasuke to stay locked away while he fought the war. If he failed to achieve the Eye of the Moon plan, he'd need to revive Madara. With Sasuke tucked away and an unlimited amount of Senju DNA (Zetsu), Tobi could facilitate the activation of Sasuke's Rinnegan.\u000a\u000aThat's where I think the story is heading. Sasuke will go to Konoha on his quest to find the ones who know everything (who I believe are the village elders), and while there, he will read the Uchiha scrolls with his new EMS. He will learn how to activate the Rinnegan, and Orochimaru will help him implant Hashirama's DNA (because his main goal is to take Sasuke's body, and Sasuke is much more useful with a Rinnegan).\u000a\u000aThat's how Madara will be taken down: Sasuke will have the ultimate eye technique, the Uchiha's Rinnegan, while Naruto will have the power of the Bijuu.

The NW and the wildlings fight within rank after Jon's "assassination," while Mel has him hidden somewhere (or his body is on ice in the ice cells, waiting for a Red Priest to revive him). Because of their infighting, the watchers on the wall allow the Others to break through. Somehow the Horn of Jaramun will play into things and **the wall WILL come down**.

VI really don't want to see Naruto become Hokage. That's not what this is really about anymore. I feel like the whole "I want to become Hokage" thing was a very childish dream, a lot like "I want to be President," no matter the reasons behind it. Now, Naruto's set to become the savior of the ninja world (and the reincarnation of the SotSP). After that, being made Hokage wouldn't really be much except for paperwork behind a desk.\u000a\u000aNaruto wanted to be Hokage to be acknowledged. That's already happened. He wanted to be the strongest ninja in the world. That, arguably, has already happened/is about to happen.\u000a\u000aIn the same way that, yeah, Jiraya would have made a good Hokage 'cause he's strong and all, he would have been a bad Hokage because a lot of being Hokage is paperwork and politics, and Jiraya wasn't big on the boring stuff. Same with Naruto. He'd much rather be a jonin, maybe an ANBU, even a "special" jonin, like Inoichi or Ibiki (I can't think of anything off the top of my head that he could do, but that's where I see him).

V&gt;Madara talks about changing fate (Izanami). Maybe this was just a translation thing. But I don't think that Izanami is going to be a one time thing in this series.\u000a\u000aI think Izanami will be the thing that stops Madara. Like Kabuto before him, Madara has tried to bypass fate. Kabuto tried to become Orochimaru, and Itachi used that for Izanami, so I can't see why someone can't do the same after Madara brought himself back to life.\u000a\u000aThis leaves two real options:\u000a\u000a1) Sasuke rejoins the battle. After he finds the one (or multiple) person who knows everything (whom I believe to be the Konoha elders, personally), he will go back to the Uchiha place and look at the tablets with his new EMS. He will find the secret of Izanagi/Izanami (and maybe some new technique)? When he joins the battle on the Allied Shinobi Forces' side, he and Naruto give and get a beat down before he resorts to Izanami, bloodlessly ending the battle.\u000a\u000a2) Tobito might just pull a Darth Vader and completely turn against Madara. Now we know he's a character who has personal ties to our cast of characters. Kakashi's teammate, Gai's classmate, Naruto's father's student. It's not so far out that some sort of situation between Madara and Kakashi could get Obito to realize that what's going on completely goes against his beliefs. A little talk-no-jutsu from Naruto, and he's ready to throw Darth Madara down the ventilation shaft of the second death star.\u000a\u000aBoth of these are somewhat anti-climatic. The first has Madara - the biggest, baddest, meanest guy around, the man who just knocked down five kage like was fighting Academy students - defeated by two teenagers (albeit powerful teenagers) in a bloodless illusion, trapped by said teenagers. The other has Tobi - the Man Who Can't Be Moved, call him No One because his identity doesn't matter - pull a complete 180. I'm not sure which is most dissatisfying.

VI'm not saying it's not still Naruto. I don't even consider it 'un-canon' unless something innately contradicts something that we find out later in the manga (like how Nagato's Rinnegan was originally multicolored in the anime the first time we saw it because Kishi didn't show a color version yet). My point is that with the exception of the filler episode this week, the last time there was a decent filler was back before the Invasion of Pain.

VI don't mind filler arcs, and I don't mind the stray episode every now and then. The ones I didn't like were the ones where each episode had a story that was independent of anything, had no impact, and didn't really have a purpose. Most of the Sea arc was downright awful, and a lot of the flashback arc after the Invasion of Pain was just boring.

VThe scene plays on like usual. Then, when the bedding starts, we get a small intro of the Rains of Castamere as some archers present themselves up top, firing arrows at Robb.\u000a\u000aThe Greatjon does his table-flip to protect the king as Freys come in from the doors wearing plate and mail armor. We see the drunken guests that remain try to fight, but they cannot. As the real fighting begins, the words themselves start to play over a montage.\u000a\u000aIn this montage, we see various Northmen inside and outside the Twins fighting the Freys. Because they are drunk, they cannot fight as well. A lot of the Northmen die. Arya and Sandor are attacked as well, and they end up having to protect themselves. Meanwhile, Cat crawls towards the knife that is lying near Jinglebell. After we see the carnage unfold, we get to the line\u000a\u000a&gt;And now the rains weep o'er his halls\u000a\u000a&gt;With no one there to hear\u000a\u000awe see a close-up on Walder Frey's face, proud at his achievement.\u000a\u000aWhen the song goes to the instrumental, Catelyn puts the knife to Jinglebells throat and has her little argument with Walder ("a son for a son", "we'll forgive this if you stop," etc.). In quick succession, Bolton stabs Robb in the back (staged like how Jon kills Qhorin, only coming from the back not the front), and Cat kills Jinglebell. Finally, a Frey cuts her throat, and Walder tells him to throw her in the river ("Heh"), as someone walks in carrying Grey Wind's corpse.\u000a\u000aBefore we fade to black, though, we see Arya make a run for it and Sandor chase her. When he finally catches up to her, he swings the axe, but we can't really tell which way the blade is facing. As the impact hits, we see Greg Spence's name, and we have an absolutely silent credit roll.\u000a\u000aThis would obviously be Episode 10, since they had their 'big' episodes as episode 9 the last two seasons and I'd hate for them to make it a pattern.

V**EDIT**: Re-formatted for spoilers. Don't feel afraid to hover over though, pretty much all of these are small teasers about the arcs that several characters go through without giving much away.\u000a\u000aIt might not be the easiest to get through. I know that Brienne's chapters get quite boring.\u000a\u000aThat said, AFFC is one of my favorite books, and definitely the favorite of the series.\u000a\u000aWe are introduced to characters in Dorne [Minor AFFC, just some names](/s "(Arianne, Doran, Areo, Arys)") and the story of how [Again, minor AFFC](/s "the Martell family is truly feeling regarding the Lannisters and their rule").\u000a\u000aWe also get to see the Ironborn [AFFC, more names](/s "(Aeron, Euron, Victarion, Asha)") and their unique culture. [ASOS/AFFC](/s "Who will become king (or queen) of the Iron Islands in the wake of Balon's death? What will the new ruler do? Will they abandon imperialism, or expand their greedy desires?")\u000a\u000aWe also get a glimpse at the politics of the Vale, as Sansa...[ASOS/AFFC](/s "er, I mean Alayne...") watches the [Again, minor AFFC](/s "grooming of Sweetrobin who has lost his mother, and Petyr Baelish, master gameplayer, Lord Paramount of the Trident and Lord Protector of the Vale, plays his game with the lords of the Vale. Will they remain neutral in this war, or will they declare for King Tommen?")\u000a\u000aWe get to see Jamie as he [minor AFFC](/s "travels the Riverlands once more").\u000a\u000aIn King's Landing, we get a glimpse into Cersei's mind as she [minor AFFC](/s "begins to rule and play the Game of Thrones as the Queen Regent over an impressionable king who is no more than a figurehead (as opposed to the ever-willful Joffrey). As she sees malicious dwarfs in every corner, will she be able to outsmart the Tyrells and the remaining court?")\u000a\u000aWe have a few Arya chapters as well. [ASOS](/s "She has crossed the Narrow Sea, and is ready to have some fun new adventures in Braavos! *Valar Moguilus*, all men must die.")\u000a\u000a[minor AFFC](/s "Samwell makes a journey south to become the New Maester. Away from the Wall and his vows, will he give in to his feelings for Gilly? What will he see when he gets down to the Citadel? And when Maester Aemon learns of Danaerys and her dragons, how does he react to the ambitions of his last remaining relative?")\u000a\u000a/end spoilers\u000a\u000aThe first time I read AFFC, I didn't like it much. In fact, it wasn't until the very end that the stories got interesting. But it provided major set-up for the events in ADWD (and beyond), and gave us our first peak at the Ironborn (without a doubt one of the most interesting cultures in the series), the Dornish (Martells are now my favorite family after this book), and the Vale (maybe not as interesting as the others, but still worth it).\u000a\u000aAFFC is very much a political book, with pretty much [minor](/s "no battles") as far as the war is concerned. It's actually the first (and only) book to not feature any sort of battle. But it's still a great read. I'm currently 3/4 of the way through ASOS on my reread, and I cannot wait to get back to AFFC. Literally that amazing.

VWell, there is a reason for a lot of this.\u000a\u000akinslayer/kingslayer/skinchanger are all descriptive of what they are. Sellsword is similar. It's what they called mercenaries. They quite literally sold their sword. These becoming common-use is understandable.\u000a\u000aThen there are places like Riverrun, Winterfell, Dragonstone, Sunspear, Starfall, and Dreadfort. Riverrrun is situated right where the 'River runs.' Someone had to name the castle, and it's simple. Winterfell is speculated to be the place where the Others (winter) fell. Dragonstone is a volcanic (volcano = lava = fire = dragon) island (land = stone). Sunspear is a very tall structure, called Sunspear like how we call tall buildings sky-scrapers. Dreadfort - the *fort* that people *dread* to go to because of flaying and torture. Starfall is where a star is said to have fallen (as someone mentions in either ASOS or AFFC, can't remember which). Stormlands are the *lands* sworn to *Storm's* End, just as the Riverlands are the *lands* sworn to *River*run.\u000a\u000aThen we have some other assorted names:\u000a\u000aSeaworth - the name that Davos had given himself when he was knighted. It's clear that this name makes reference to his smuggling, and how it paid off.\u000a\u000aLittlefinger - the Baelish were minor lords of the *little*st *finger* in the Vale. He's also described as a smaller man in stature.\u000a\u000aGreyjoy - a someone juxtapositic name. Grey is the color that first comes to mind when thinking of Pyke/The Iron Islands. It's bleak, unforgiving. Grey-Joy. It's ironic, isn't it?\u000a\u000aHighgarden - Garden, as in the Flowers (Tyrell). The Reach and Highgarden are both plentiful with fields and greenery. A garden, of sorts. High could possibly refer to elevation, or even the way that their people see themselves (remember, the Tyrells were very powerful pre-rebellion).\u000a\u000aShavepates were Meereenese who supported Dany, and showed support by *shav*ing their *pate* (head) of the custom hairstyle worn by the Meereenese aristocrats.\u000a\u000aSweetrobin is Robert Arryn's nickname. **Rob**ert Ar**ryn**, **Robyn**, **Robin**. It's a nickname. Lysa (and Alyse) call him Sweetrobin as a pet name.\u000a\u000aKingsguard is another obvious one - they guard the king. If I had to name them, Kingsguard would be one of the first things I'd think of.\u000a\u000aBlackfish - the nickname Hoster gave Brynden when he was mad. Tully = Fish. Hoster was pissed, and black is a negative color (in terms of symbolism). Therefore, Blackfish.\u000a\u000aI could keep going on, but I think you get the point that most of these are easily explanable.

VThat's a roundabout explanation. If Rickon, Jon, or Stannis save the world, then **they're** a hero, not necessarily Davos. By that same standard, it could be Wyman Manderly who saved Davos who saved Rickon, or Stannis, who refused to let Ser Axell give Davos to the fires. Hell, it could be Davos' parents who gave birth to him or the guy who gave Davos his first ship. Saying someone's a hero because they helped bring about circumstances to allow something heroic to happen isn't a logical argument.

"You cannot hid from me, child. Come closer now."\u000a\u000a&gt;Cold fingers walked down Arya's neck. *Fear cuts deeper than swords*, she reminded herself. She stood and approached the fire warily, light on the balls of her feet, poised to flee.\u000a\u000a&gt;The dwarf woman studied her with dim red eyes. "I see you," she whispered. "I see you, wolf child. Blood child. I thought it was the lord who smelled of death..." She began to sob, her little body shaking. "You are cruel to come to my hill, cruel. I gorged on grief at Summerhall, I need none of yours. Begone from here, dark heart. Begone!"\u000a\u000a&gt;There was such a fear in her voice that Arya took a step backward, wondering if the woman was mad.

VSasuke was still a child when he had his entire family killed by his brother (who was forced to leave the village). He spent years shutting himself out from the world because he had no one.\u000a\u000aObito was still a kid when shit went down. He was torn from his life, presumed dead, and (most likely) manipulated by Madara. And we wasn't arrogant at all.\u000a\u000aItachi wasn't arrogant either. He still ended up forced to kill his whole family and then pretend to be a psychotic murderer and leave the village.\u000a\u000aAs far as we know, Izuna had his eyes taken by his older brother by force.

Everyone else only learned arrogance after dealing with the emotional trauma that was handed to them.

VIn senior year, I was in an English elective where we made t-shirts to sell to the rest of the school. We were supposed to go around and collect money for the shirts before they were ordered, and we'd ask people that we knew if they wanted one.\u000a\u000aThis one girl got really into it, and ended up getting about fifteen people to pony up the ten dollars for the shirt (not many people really tried to sell, to be honest). Then, three days before the money was due to be collected, someone stole her backpack which had all the money and names of the people who ordered the shirts.\u000a\u000aGetting their names was the easy part. The hard part was getting back the $150 to buy the shirts or return to the people. In the end, she was only able to get about $70 to the teacher, who was going to open up her own wallet to pay the remaining $80. Instead, after class, I walked up to the teacher and handed her a $100 bill. I asked for her not to tell anyone.\u000a\u000aNaturally, the next day, she told *everyone*, but at least left my name out. I ended up getting $60 back because the teacher insisted on paying half of the remainder herself. It was the most charitable thing I've done to date, and I still remember the look on the girl's face when she heard that someone offered to donate the remainder for her.

VAerys already earned the title after he did things like fry Brandon Stark and make Rickard hang himself. In fact, it was well-known before the sack of King's Landing that Aerys had a particular love for wildfire, and even made a pyromancer his Hand for a fortnight before the Sack.\u000a\u000aPeople would recognize wildfire from regular fire. People would know that the only one who had access to the wildfire was the Mad King who a) was fascinated by fire, b) had an 'in' with the pyromancers, and c) had time to prepare all the wildfire going off, versus the rebels who have a) no known fascination with fire, b) had no 'in' with the pyromancers, and c) have been spending the last few months fighting well north of the city.\u000a\u000aIn addition, Aerys had the pots placed so that the entire city would burn. The destructive powers of wildfire are immense, and I wouldn't put money on there being too many survivors inside the city walls.

King Rhaegar would have to either allow himself to be cornered at his seat in Dragonstone, or he would retreat further into the Reach/Dorne. Either way, the rebels would seem to be the winners of the war, and lords in the Reach and Dorne would start to lose faith in staying loyal.

VIf Robert is killed on the Trident, then Tywin Lannister either a) doesn't declare himself or b) declares himself for the Targaryens, who seem to be the victors. In addition, the Freys would likely declare for the Targaryen's (remember, they arrived at the Trident late to declare for the winner).\u000a\u000aWith Robert dead, Storm's End would go to Stannis, who, having no loyalty to Ned Stark or Jon Arryn in particular, would bend the knee in exchange for keeping his seat. All the power of Storm's End and the Stormlands would be handed to the Targaryen forces.\u000a\u000aAt this point, the Rebellion would have the power of Winterfell/the North, the Eyrie/Vale, and Riverrun/The Riverlands. Meanwhile, the Targaryens have their own Dragonstone/the Narrow Sea, Highgarden/The Reach, Sunspear/Dorne, Storm's End/Stormlands, and possibly Casterly Rock/The Westerlands. It's looking bad for the Rebellion.\u000a\u000aThe leadership of the rebellion is still under the leadership of Jon Arryn and Ned Stark, who both know that if they do not succeed in the rebellion, then both the North, the Vale, and the Riverlands will be savagely destroyed. Both the North and the Vale are well-protected, and if it boiled down to just those two lone kingdoms surviving, they would likely just declare themselves independent and throw back armies at the Bloody Gate/Moat Cailin.\u000a\u000aHowever, by marrying Jon to Lysa and Ned to Catelyn, they have brought the Tullys and the Riverlands into the conflict. The one thing we know from the War of Five Kings is that the Riverlands have no natural defenses like the Vale, nor do they have an impenetrable fortress to protect them like the North. Both Ned and Jon would be forced to stay and fight the Targaryen forces in the Riverlands.\u000a\u000aIt would occur to them that they need the Lannisters. At this point, if the Lannisters had declared for Aerys, the war would undoubtedly be over. We'll call this Option #1: Tywin, Rhaegar, and Mace Tyrell would march to the Riverlands and destroy them, laying Riverrun to seige. After a long seige, Hoster Tully bends the knee, and Walder Frey become the Lord Paramount of the Trident.\u000a\u000aThen, Jon and Ned would close the North and the Vale, and throw back the Targaryen armies. Between the Northman and the Knights of the Vale, there is no doubt that the Rebellion succeeds in liberating the North and the Vale, and Ned Stark becomes the first King in the North in centuries. The Vale will likely chose to be a part of that kingdom or will just be an allying kingdom.\u000a\u000aNow, let's rewind a little bit to before the Targaryen armies destroy the Riverlands and look at Tywin Lannister. If he declared for Aerys, then all that happens. If he remains neutral, then he will be courted by the rebellion. Perhaps a marriage between Cersei and Edmure?\u000a\u000aIf Tywin is courted and refuses, then our first path still happens. If Tywin joins the rebellion, then we have a game changer. First thing's first, Aerys has Jamie killed. Jamie takes out as many enemies as possible, but he can't protect himself for long.\u000a\u000aCersei marries Edmure, and the joint forces of Lannisters/Tullys/Arryns/Starks are able to move south. The westerners probably meet a force from Highgarden near Lannisport. If the Lannisters are victorious, then they continue to move south. If not, the Tyrells are able to attack Lannisport and Casterly Rock, sacking the city and destroying the castle. That would end Tywin's strength and lead to option #1. If Tywin marches south, it means hope.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, in the East, the Arryn/Stark/Tully forces march down the Kingsroad. They realize that the only way to win the war is to lay seige to King's Landing. A force from White Harbor and another from Gulltown leave to attack King's Landing from sea. After some minor battles at Duskendale and/or Rosby, the rebels reach King's Landing. Because it's closed, the Northerners must siege.\u000a\u000aIf the siege isn't ended by a force from Dorne/Stormlands, then the rebellion wins. The people of King's Landing don't have it in them to face a prolonged seige. The Battle of the Blackwater proved that much. As the peasants grow angrier, Aerys grows more and more paranoid. When the Master of Coin in charge of the gold cloaks realizes that the king's cause is lost, he opens the gate and lets in the rebels.\u000a\u000aIf a force from Dorne/Stormlands come to King's Landing's aid, then the rebellion will face an even larger set-back. Meanwhile, if Tywin won the battle near Lannisport, then he marches south, meets Highgarden again near Goldengrove. No matter how many victories he has, it isn't likely that the Tyrells will bend the knee. They're too proud. That fighting either ends at Casterly Rock with Tywin's death or at Highgarden with Mace's.\u000a\u000aI could go on and on, but as you see, the outcome all depends on Tywin's allegiance, and the outcome of many more battles in the South.

He marches his host to King's Landing to "save" the city, but instead sacks it as Jamie kills Aerys.\u000a\u000aIf Robert is killed on the Trident, then Tywin Lannister either a) doesn't declare himself or b) declares himself for the Targaryens, who seem to be the victors.

VKeeping peace isn't the only good thing for a king. Robert was an awful king, despite the fact that the realm was generally united under his rule. He brought Westeros into massive internal and external debt. He allowed infighting between major houses (Stark/Lannister).\u000a\u000aI think the thing that would make Stannis an awful king is that, like Ned, Robert, and Robb, he can't play the game of thrones. He wouldn't give up any power to people like the Tyrells or the Martells due to their backing of other rulers. He would make enemies due to his stiffness, and it would lead to a lack of internal stability for all.\u000a\u000aThat's why, if Stannis does manage to win the throne from the Lannister/Tyrells, he will almost definitely lose when Dany invades.

She will conquer Jhoqo's khalasaar, lead them south to beat the Yunkai (and maybe Ironborn) in battle, and then turn back north with her full khalasaar - including her Unsullied and the freed slaves, and possibly some sell-swords - to Vaes Dothrak, where the HotU vision of 'crones bowing to her' will come true. Then she will go back west to cross the Narrow Sea.\u000a\u000aOr she'll just stay in Meereen until the end of time. I wouldn't put it past GRMM.

VI want Dany to rule all of Westeros. She's the only person out of the potential rulers we still have (Stannis, Tommen/Cersei, Aegon, Euron) who has shown that she could be a good ruler.\u000a\u000aStannis is too rigid. Someone said of him that he'll break before he bends. He's so much like Ned Stark, doing what *should* be right, not what needs to be done.\u000a\u000aTommen is too young to rule, and Cersei is absolutely batshit nuts. She has never shown any compassion to her subjects as Regent. I would even say she's a worse ruler than Robert was, just because he surrounded himself with competent people to rule the realm while she surrounds herself with enemies and backhanded friends that she doesn't even trust.\u000a\u000aWhile we have not seen Aegon enough to make a good prediction of what type of ruler he would be, I can't see a catspawn of Illyrio and Varys being what is necessarily best for the realm. It feels like he's a means to their ends, and putting that means in such a high position of power would be dangerous.\u000a\u000aEuron is...well, Euron. Like Cersei, he is self-absorbed in his own power. He can be a conqueror, he could even be a king, but he can't be a good ruler for his subjects.\u000a\u000aWe could talk about the past kings/rulers - Robb, Robert, Joffrey, Tywin (sort of), Tyrion (sort of), Renly, and Balon - but what would that help. There are some potential rulers out there, such as Asha, Theon, Victarion, etc, but as of now, they aren't significant candidates to be considered rulers.\u000a\u000aOut of our remaining rulers, Danaerys Stormborn has shown to be the only one who can rule for her people. In Meereen, despite crushing hard on Daario, she puts him aside and marries Hidhar zo Loraq to stop the mass murders. She allows the fighting pits to re-open, because despite her displeasure with it, it is best for the economy of Meereen. She tries to sue for a peace with the Yunkai instead of saying "you know what? I have Unsullied, I can win." She does make mistakes, as any 16 year old girl would, but she seems to be a much more compassionate, caring, and - at the end of the day - responsible leader than any of the other kings.

VI think the ones who know everything are Koharu and Homura, the two Konoha elders.\u000a\u000aThis whole 'The One Who Knows Everything' thing started right after Sasuke saw Itachi's memories, including the part about the elders discussing the Uchiha coup.\u000a\u000aOf course, not knowing what was in the scroll Suigetsu found, none of us are really sure the types of questions he's asking. However, the elders can be connected to everything.\u000a\u000a* The Uchiha Massacre - for obvious reasons\u000a\u000a* Hashirama/Madara - they are Hiruzen's age, so they were young adults when Tobirama was Hokage and teenagers (Naruto/Sasuke age) when Hashirama was Hokage and shit went down.\u000a\u000a* Everything that went on in Konoha while Hiruzen, Minato, and Tsunade were all Hokage - they were the village elders.\u000a\u000aThey are the two people still living who have lived through pretty much all of Konoha's history. No matter what the scroll involves, chances are they were alive for it.\u000a\u000aAlso, Orochimaru talks about going to 'a place Sasuke knows well,' like the village. Could you imagine every shinobi out fighting the war, and Orochimaru and Sasuke just walk into the Leaf (which also happens to be where Karin - the missing member of Taka - is currently plotting her escape from the Konoha jail).

Not only would Obito have to have pulled a complete 180 fairly quickly. No character has gone so against the main ideal which they once believed in, and certainly not so quickly.\u000a\u000a3. He could be referring to himself. It seems like Tobi's plans are somewhat intertwined with Madara's. It's not clear.\u000a\u000a4. He recognizes Tobi from some other point in time. He would not recognize Obito. There is nothing in there that points to Madara in any way.\u000a\u000a6. It's in the middle of the incident. After Minato has already seen him during Naruto's birth. He would have already recognized the chakra.\u000a\u000a8. "Just a fact." I need you to prove that. All you do is assert it as fact when it's just a guess.\u000a\u000a9.

VCounter-Counterargument:\u000a\u000a1. Tobi had to have a lot of skill and knowledge in that fight. He'd have to have already come up with the Eye of the Moon Plan, figured out everything regarding the Bijuu/Juubi and the Sage of Six Paths, and have some sort of reason to go through with this. In addition to that, he'd have to have awakened his Mangekyo Sharingan and essentially mastered Kamui. To give you perspective, Kakashi awakened his MS sometime in the time-skip, and is only *now* showing true proficiency.\u000a\u000a2. Sasuke didn't go against an ideal that he once had. His life was devoted to making the person responsible for his adolescent loneliness pay. When he found out that it wasn't Itachi, he continued with his ideal by attempting to get revenge on the elders/Danzo/Konoha. In fact, so many people dislike Sasuke because he *didn't* change his ideal after finding out about Itachi.\u000a\u000a3. He didn't believe he was Madara. It's already been stated that he was using the name 'Madara Uchiha' to provoke the Five Kage into war. As for 'playing at' Madara, there was no need to say anything at all. The statement would be a pointless statement unless he had actually been (for lack of a better word) excited that he could impliment his plan.\u000a\u000a4. He did recognize Madara. The Kyuubi's been proven to show distinction between Sharingan users. In the scene early on in Shippuden at Orochimaru's hideout (when Sasuke used his Sharingan to enter Naruto's subconscious with the Kyuubi), the Kyuubi is able to make a distinction between Sasuke and Madara.\u000a\u000a5. I will give you that one, because 5 was a pretty weak argument anyway.\u000a\u000a6. How was Minato working under the assumption that Tobi was Madara? He only came to that conclusion towards the end of the fight. Besides, whether or not Obito was using similar techniques, his chakra would still be the same.\u000a\u000a7. I'll give you this one, too...Madara's time of death was never explicitly stated, and the 'Nagato/Tobi's Rinnegan were Madara's' are just fan theory (which I do happen to believe, but there isn't enough evidence for it to be called a fact).\u000a\u000a8. Saying that Tobi was just pretending is a really bad argument, because there's nothing to indicate that he was.\u000a\u000a9. But WHY!? If you're going to make a grand claim that Tobi treated himself as if he was Madara when he's all alone, you have to have some sort of evidence to back you up.\u000a\u000a10. The tablet in the village is in the middle of the Uchiha section of the village. I would argue that it's almost impossible for someone to sneak into the village, in the midst of all his family, while he's pretending to be dead.\u000a\u000a11. Again, you assert Tobi referring to himself as Madara when he's alone, yet have no evidence to back it up. That which can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without it as well.

Tyrion's biggest flaw is his emotions. But he's not king, so his mistakes aren't as awful.\u000a\u000aThe point of my statement is this: if Rhaegar could let his emotions overcome him to the point where he acts rashly and runs off with a betrothed lady, he wouldn't make a great king. He would have to learn the lesson that Dany learned in Meereen - his life is for the people, not for himself. It's a sacrifice that *good* kings must make.\u000a\u000aIt's why Ned married Catelyn. Sure, they ended up falling in love, but they didn't marry out of emotion. They got married because it was what was best for their cause (Robet's Rebellion).\u000a\u000aIt's why Dany married Hedahr. She didn't love him at all, but if she didn't do it, her subjects would have suffered.\u000a\u000aIt's why Joffery married Margaery. He didn't have real feelings for her, but it allowed the Lannisters to secure an alliance with the Tyrells and stop Stannis from sacking King's Landing. Of course, this specific example wasn't such an imposition, but it shows that those with power in Westeros can't allow themselves to live their lives selfishly. They have to think about their subject and the realm first.

Also, *prince* is a loose term. There are princes in Dorne. There are other Targaryen princes (Viserys). Since Valyrian is often called a 'genderless' language, it could refer to princesses as well. Nothing about dragons was said in the prophecy, either, so there really isn't much that pointed to Rhaegar.\u000a\u000a&gt;''And lo, Steve shall marry Anna and from her loin shall come forth the prince that was promised!'' Prophecies are prophecies. Why Anna and not any random chick? Because the prophecy said so.\u000a\u000aI don't remember any prophecy that mentions Lyanna. There was nothing to suggest her over countless other women.\u000a\u000a&gt;That's because you can't prove a negative dipshit. Why would there be a single vision that is a blatant lie? It would make the entire sequence completely pointless.\u000a\u000aThe vision could have been a fabrication to tell Dany about the prophecy. It didn't have to have actually happened. Just like the vision of Rhaego didn't actually happen.

V&gt;How on earth do you get the impression that Rhaegar is hot-headed?\u000a\u000aAs I said, the way that he runs off with Lyanna despite knowing the consequences seems to be a poor move. If he thought about it, he should have realized that offending the Baratheons and the Starks wouldn't bode well for the realm.\u000a\u000a&gt;The only reason he was with Lyanna was because he needed another kid to fulfill prophecies and save the world.\u000a\u000aHe did have a wife who seemed to be pretty fertile. Besides, there are plenty of other women he could have had children with that wouldn't have pissed off major houses and lords.\u000a\u000a&gt;Rhaegar is portrayed as someone who is extremely successful at everything he sets his mind to. Him being a bad king would go against everything that's ever been written about him.\u000a\u000aI already mentioned this. We only hear of Rhaegar through the POV of others, like Jon Connington who loved him, or Barristan Selmy who was like family. We've also heard stories that Viserys told Dany about him, but neither of them are really good sources on Rhaegar because they're family.\u000a\u000aWe've never really personally seen Rhaegar. The only thing we definitively know about him that has no bias whatsoever is that he ran off with Lyanna. That was a bad move all around. Either he acted without thinking of the consequences, or he understood the consequences and decided to go through with it anyway.\u000a\u000aVarys' description of Aegon were true. He was taught that it was his duty to rule, and to consider the people before himself. That's what Dany is learning as Queen of Meereen (ex. marrying Hizdahr zo Loraq despite not loving him). If Rhaegar wanted to rule for the people, then he would have found a different woman to bare his children, or he would have had Elia give him a third child.

He exhibits this trait when he "kidnaps" Lyanna. Even if it was completely consensual (which I do believe is true), Rhaegar should have known that the consequences of running off with her would be disastrous.\u000a\u000aWithout *really* getting to know Rhaegar except from the POV of other characters (ie Jon Connington, who loved him, or Barristan Selmy, who was like family to him), we can't really tell what Rhaegar would be like as a ruler.\u000a\u000aI know that if I was a Targaryen ally at this time, when I heard that Rhaegar and Lyanna ran off together, I would have lost a significant amount of faith in Rhaegar's leadership ability.\u000a\u000aEDIT: Sorry, Rhaegar was *rash*, not *hot-headed*.

They were on a dangerous mission. Rin, Minato, and anyone else you may refer to (besides his father) died after that. Conversely, Sasuke had the trauma of his entire family being murdered in one night by one of the people he trusted most - all while he's still a child.\u000a\u000aYes, the death of Kakashi's father would be traumatic for Kakashi, but in a totally different way than the Uchiha Massacre was for Sasuke.

VI'd like to bring the point you made about being ungrateful.\u000a\u000aMy understanding of this argument is that you believe that the empathy and support that his teammates/friends offered should have been good enough for him, yet he still insisted that he was all alone.\u000a\u000aYou say that Naruto and Kakashi went through similar traumas, by which I assume you mean Naruto being the Jinchuriki and rejected by the village and Kakashi's traumatic experience with Obito during the Third Shinobi World War.\u000a\u000aLet's start with Naruto. Naruto grew up always knowing that he was rejected - he never had a reason, but it was the reality he'd always known. Sasuke grew up having everything, and lost it all. Of course, Sasuke already pointed that out in his battle with Naruto at the VotE, but there's another difference: ever since Sasuke was a child, he'd focused all his anger and pain at Itachi. Hating Itachi was as integral to his existence as breathing was by the time he'd reached the Valley of the End.\u000a\u000aNaruto was able to say 'Shit Happens' and work to move past it. Sasuke was stuck in the past and couldn't move past it.\u000a\u000aThe situation with Kakashi and Obito is completely different from Sasuke's story in every way, which makes me wonder why you included Kakashi in your list of people with similar traumas.\u000a\u000aI don't have any counterargument for your second point (about how other characters revere him as a god), so I'll move on to your third point - the way he handled learning Itachi's secret.\u000a\u000aAgain, he'd focused all the trauma from his childhood into hate that he aimed at Itachi. In doing so, his parents/family/clan became the ultimate good in Sasuke's eyes - he grew up understanding them to be the ultimate victims in Itachi's psychopathic rampage.\u000a\u000aAfter he learns that Itachi not only didn't massacre his family in cold blood but also took on all these burdens for Sasuke, Sasuke's first and only instinct is to do what he's been doing all his life - blame someone. He can't blame Itachi for the situation, because all he did was protect Sasuke. He can't blame his clan for it either, because they have become Sasuke's image of the 'ultimate good' from an early age.\u000a\u000aThe only other people to blame are the elders of the village - they were the ones who decided to assign Itachi with his mission instead of attempt to settle the peace peacefully. As readers with no deep-seeded hatred or love for any piece of this, we can blame the Uchiha clan for attempting to revolt and name them 'the bad guy.' But Sasuke has indoctrinated himself against that, and only has Konoha to blame.\u000a\u000aFor Sasuke, it isn't about 'spitting on Itachi's sacrifice.' In fact, it isn't about Itachi at all. It's about lashing out against those who took everything from him - his family, his innocence, his life. Itachi doesn't even play much of a role in it anymore.\u000a\u000aYour final (minor) complaint about Sasuke brooding all the time is also a valid complaint, but it also makes sense in the scheme of the character.   Sasuke became a recluse after his clan's massacre. He became his own parent, providing for himself. He didn't particularly speak to other people much. This naturally leads to him being a bit more broody.\u000a\u000aI'm not trying to say that your reasons for disliking Sasuke are invalid. I just find that I have a better appreciation for characters I don't like when I psychoanalyze where they come from, how they grew up, and things like that. I used to hate Sasuke and not understand why he did anything he did, but when I look at it in this light, I don't see it as Sasuke being ungrateful, I see it as him being so fucked up by the situation he was put in that his rational is skewed.

VThe entire series has been one big lead-up to where the manga is now. So far the only parts of the plot that need to be tied up are Orochimaru, Tobi, Madara, and Sasuke. I assume that by defeating Tobi, you are including ending the war, which would involve stopping Madara from fucking shit up and stopping Sasuke from attacking Konoha.\u000a\u000aIf Orochimaru is taken care of in this arc, then the story is over. There is nothing else to do. Let it end.\u000a\u000aIf Orochimaru isn't taken care of, then it leads the series back to where it was at the beginning of Part II, for the most part, with stories revolving around Orochimaru and Sasuke. If Sasuke dies or is brought back to the village, then there are very few potential plotlines to use after Orochimaru is taken care of. If Sasuke stays bad, then we could potentially see another arc or two involving him.\u000a\u000aBasically, though, this arc seems to be the last major arc. It's the climax of the series. After the war is over, there isn't much left to do.

VI'm behind the "Tobi is Rin" theory, mostly because I don't see how it can be Obito.\u000a\u000a1. Tobi has never been seen using Mangekyo Sharingan or EMS. He's only ever used the Sharingan and the Rinnegan.\u000a\u000a2. We know from Kakashi having Obito's eye that transplanted eyes with dojutsu don't "turn off." Likewise, Tobi's eyes are always in their Sharingan/Rinnegan. This leads me to believe that the Sharingan and the Rinnegan were implanted - meaning that Tobi can't be an Uchiha.\u000a\u000a3. It is heavily implied that Tobi's Sharingan could be the other Obito-eye, due to the connection between Tobi's Sharingan and Kakashi's Sharingan. The only person who was on-hand to take Obito's right eye and had the skill-set to transplant it was Rin.\u000a\u000a4. The last chapter showed us that Tobi likely has a past with Kakashi, having to do with Obito and the promises he made. That narrows down the list of candidates exponentially (bye Tobirama/Hashirama/Zetsu/Ichiraku guy).\u000a\u000a5. We have never seen Rin in present-day Naruto, nor were we given an actual explanation of what happened to her.\u000a\u000a6. Having nothing to do with the Naruto world and all to do with the real world, Masashi Kishimoto loves to do these big dramatic plot twists. Everyone has spent the last year + theorizing which powerful, epic, *male* shinobi Tobi actually is - it would be awesome for the truth to be as far away from that as possible.\u000a\u000a7. Also having more to do with the behind-the-scenes, Rin seems like the option with the most actual fallout. Not only do we get some major drama, but we could also see some new moves. If she really is Tobi, and Tobi is forced to actually fight using a different strategy (now that Kakashi has figured out how to beat the space-time ninjutsu), we could see some of Rin's jutsu. We've never seen how she fights, nor have we really seen her skills besides being a medical ninja. There are a lot of possibilities there.

We also see a glimpse of Arya in Braavos.\u000a\u000aThe first half of ADWD, without spoiling anything, is about Jon as he begins his reign as Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, Davos as he tries to help Stannis some more, Theon and what has happened since Ramsay Snow has taken Winterfell, Dany ruling Meereen, Tyrion on the run, and maybe something else that I might be forgetting.\u000a\u000aThese two books have a small story that sets up the rest.\u000a\u000aThe second 'trilogy' in ASoIaF is the second half of ADWD that combines the stories in the first half with continuations of the stories in AFFC, followed by The Winds of Winter and A Dream of Spring, the latter two not having been released) cover a completely different story than the first 'trilogy.' Because ASOS spent so much time knocking down the dominoes, it takes some time for AFFC and ADWD to really pick up, but when they do, they're just as good as ASOS. They just have to reset the dominoes again.\u000a\u000aI think one of the reasons AFFC gets such a bad rep is because of the way it was released. ASOS left us with tons of cliffhangers, and only half were resolved in AFFC. Readers waited five years, and they got only half of what they wanted. Many of the 'favorites' (Tyrion, Arya, Dany, Jon, etc.) were in ADWD, and didn't appear in AFFCC (well, Arya had a few chapters, but nothing that would sate a reader). Readers had to wait five *more* years before we saw a lot of the other stuff.\u000a\u000aAFFC has a lot of great things, though. The Cersei chapters are incredible. I especially liked the ironborn chapters, even though I dislike the characters. It was nice to get a glimpse into that world. Same with the Dorne chapters and the chapters with Sansa and Littlefinger in the Vale. The Jamie chapters and the Brienne chapters were the slowest, in my opinion, but they were still pretty good.\u000a\u000a**TLDR: Definitely read AFFC and ADWD...they are just so good that you can't put them down.**\u000a

V&gt;What will happen to Daenerys now that she is set to leave Qarth?\u000a\u000aWell, Jorah said that this ship will be taking them to Astapor. I looked at the map of Essos/Westeros and saw that it is close to Old Valyria, and since Dany is a Targaryen (the blood of Old Valyria), I think she might somehow make her way there on her journey to Westeros and begin learning more about her parentage and about dragon training. Maybe there are dragons there that are kept secret from the world? Old Valyria sounds like a very magical place, so there's bound to be something big there. She might also make it back north towards the Dothraki to unite the different khalasaars (can you say Mare that Mounts the World?) I think with her dragons, and maybe some allies from Qarth, Astapor, Valyria, and some other places, she could take out the new khals, unite the Dothraki, and in Season 4/5 be ready to land in Westeros with an army.\u000a\u000a&gt;What are your expectations for the intrigues in King's Landing now that the Tyrells have arrived and Tryion is no longer Hand?\u000a\u000aI think there will be some clashing between Lannister and Tyrells. The Tyrells are a rich family, but they've been conspicuously absent from the politics of King's Landing so far. I'm sure Joffrey will treat Margaery like shit, which will piss off the Knight of Flowers. As for Tyrion, I think his bark will be much worse than his bite next season, as he'll be powerless. He's in a city where he has no power, and his powerful sister wants to kill him, so I suspect he'll leave the city by the end of the season with Shae.\u000a\u000a&gt;Jon and the wildlings?\u000a\u000aJon will get very close to some wildlings (Ygritte in particular). I have no doubt they'll end up doing the horizontal bop in a wildling tent. I think that the wildlings are gathering for a reason, and if Qoren Halfhand's suspicions mean anything, then they're likely gathering for some sort of attack on the wall (also going from Ygritte telling Jon that the lands of the North are the free peoples' by right). I think that by the time Jon has to choose between the wildlings and the Watch, he'll choose the watch, but he'll be unhappy, and he might bring Ygritte with him.\u000a\u000a&gt; The Night's Watch, the White Walkers, and their wights (zombies)?\u000a\u000aI think that they're fucked. Either they light fires to stop the whites/wights which attracts wildlings, or they'll fall back to the Wall or Craster's or something. I think when Jon returns, they'll be distrustful of him. I also think that Sam's going to have a big role to play. For some reason, that first white walker that passed him by without so much as a second thought makes me think that they're looking for something, and Sam's the only main character with the Watch right now.\u000a\u000a&gt;What will happen now that Robb is married and facing a stronger Lannister enemy?\u000a\u000aUnfortunately, I think the war is almost over for him. He's been shown to have a good mind for battle, but he plays the game poorly. If he was smart, he'd have married the Frey girl and just kept Talisa on the side, or he'd arrange some other marriages to secure alliances in the Reach or Dorne. I think Lysa and the Vale is going to come back into play in the next season. But the fact that she has so far remained undeclared for her sister and nephew probably means she's siding with the Lannisters, or at least someone else.\u000a\u000a&gt;What about Theon and the other ironborn?\u000a\u000aI think Theon will be taken South to Robb. After looking at the map, it looks like the Ironborn (who have Deepwood Motte, Moat Cailin, and Torrhen Square) have the Western area of the North, while Bolton's bastard "of the Dreadfort" maintains a foothold in the Eastern area. I think it's possible - if Robb can get past the Twins - for Robb and Bolton's bastard to squeeze the ironborn at Moat Cailin, and begin to retake the north. Of course, the Twins do pose a serious obstacle. Because of Yara's statement about their power coming from the sea, I don't see the ironborn attempting to expand much past the Neck, although maybe into the Riverlands.\u000a\u000a&gt;Bran and his group?\u000a\u000aI think they'll head North, but get separated. I feel like Bran is mature enough to take charge and get himself and Hodor to the wall, but part of me feels like Osha and Rickon will end up captured by Yara. Without Theon there to tell her that Rickon is Rickon, I feel like she'd take him under her wing somehow (sort of like Arya/Tywin, except if Tywin trained Arya to fight). I think it would be poetic justice: Ned **Stark** raised Theon **Greyjoy**, and so Yara **Greyjoy** raises Rickon **Stark**. I might be way off on this one.\u000a\u000a&gt;Stannis and his red priestess?\u000a\u000aI think without their Navy and their army, Stannis will have to regroup. He'll probably ally himself with the ironborn or with some people from the Free Cities/Essos (but not Robb, because he considers Robb an usurper). I think he'll be more determined than ever to win, and he might try a new strategy. But whatever he decides, he'll keep Mellisandre close to him. There will be much more magic used.\u000a\u000a&gt;Arya?\u000a\u000aI have a feeling that she'll get separated from Gendry and Hot Pie somehow. I don't think she'll make it to the Riverlands, because GRRM doesn't like good things happening. I'll say she might go to the Vale, or maybe to the Reach or Dorne. I'm not sure who the Brothers Without Banners are, but she may interact with them a bit.\u000a\u000a&gt;Jaime and Brienne?\u000a\u000aI think they'll have loads of sexual tension, and she'll develop feelings for him. They might be reciprocated, but he won't act on them due to his love for Cersei. I feel like they'll definitely make it to King's Landing, with a little bumps in the road of course. I think back in King's Landing, when he finds out that Cersei's been fucking Lancel, he'll be really pissed off and maybe hook up with Brienne. She's so fierce in battle, but I feel like she's just a little girl inside ready to get her heart broken :(\u000a\u000a&gt;Varys and Littlefinger\u000a\u000aI don't think they'll have much more interaction in the next season. Varys is still the man in the shadows, barely considered a man by almost everyone, and Littlefinger is the man who went from being a lowborn peasant to being one of the greatest lords in the realm. I think there will be more game-of-throne-playing for Littlefinger as he tries to make himself bigger. Since Harrenhal is right near the Riverlands, I feel like he'll have a big role to play in the war there, which might make him a bigger deal. With Tywin in KL, maybe Littlefinger will become the Warden of the West?\u000a\u000a&gt;What new locations do you expect to see?\u000a\u000aI'd like to see Casterly Rock, for one. Highgarden/the Reach. I'd like to see Myrcella in Dorne - I feel like that kingdom is too quiet during this war, despite being firmly a Lannister ally. I think we might see Braavos, and maybe some more free cities. Some more places beyond the wall. We might see Yara and the ironborn in the rest of the north that we have yet to see. I think we'll see some more Essos with Dany's story, probably Astapor, some of the surrounding cities, and maybe Old Valyria. We'll probably see the Vale again, although that's not a new location. I also feel like we have not seen the last of Drogo's old khalasaar in the Dothraki Plains.

VHere's how I see ASoS being made into Season 3 &amp; 4:\u000a\u000aThe beginning of ASoS is pretty boring in comparison to much of the series. A lot of it is basically Arya getting captured and recaptured, Jon breaking his oath over and over by fucking Ygritte, and Tyrion adjusting to not being the Hand of the King, with very little there.\u000a\u000aI think there will be much more focus on Dany in the cities she conquers than in the books, and we will probably see a little bit more in that vein. We will also have some minor story line changes in the Brienne/Jamie story, most likely, and possibly the Arya story.\u000a\u000aIn episode 7, we'll probably meet Beric Dondarrion again, and by the end of episode 8, Arya and Sandor will be off on their magical adventure.\u000a\u000aThe Red Wedding will probably be episode 9 or 10, most likely the latter. The RW is about 2/3 into the book, so if they condense a lot of the first half, they can squeeze that in at the end. I think due to the cliffhanger factor of Arya/Sandor and the entire wedding as a whole, it will be made episode 10. If the RW is put in episode 9, then Episode 10 will likely end with a shot of Robb with Grey Wind's head sewed on his neck, as a little "OMG" factor for the audience.\u000a\u000aThen there's Season 4, which will probably see Joffery's wedding, Tyrion's train and subsequent escape. We may see, after Prince Oberyn is killed, some scenes from Dorne. Likewise, when we find out that King Balon is dead, we will probably see some AFFC scenes with the Greyjoys and the Ironborn. Again, we will see a lot of Dany, and probably a decent amount of Arya/Sandor and Sansa/Littlefinger. We'll also see a decent amount of focus put on the Night's Watch.\u000a\u000aOf course, there will likely also be some changes in this season as well, a la Dany's dragon's being stolen by Pyatt Pree and Arya being Tywin's cup bearer.\u000a\u000aEpisode 9 of Season 4 will probably include the Trial by Combat for Tyrion, and Episode 10 will feature his escape/Tywin and Shae's murder.\u000a\u000aOf course, the one thing that they may do is have some scenes with Osha/Rickon. We don't really get to see them much after the split from Bran, Jojen, Meera, and Hodor. Since GRRM works somewhat closely with the show, he may decide to give them some focus, although I'm not completely sure on that one.

Without downvoting, there could be a spike in the number of irrelevant/annoying posts in this subreddit.\u000a\u000aOn the other hand, you are right that the people in the subreddit in general are too heavy-handed with the downvote button when it comes to relevant discussions/posts, and taking away the ability to downvote does help in that sense.\u000a\u000aIn the end, it is your decisions to make, but I thought I'd throw out my concerns.

VItachi gave it the command to "save Konoha," and it would awaken when the Mangekyo Sharingan was exposed to Naruto. He figured the next time someone with a Mangekyo Sharingan would see Naruto would be when/if Sasuke attacked the Leaf Village. Instead, Itachi was the first to see Naruto, and the crow used its genjutsu to cancel out the control that Kabuto was exerting over him.\u000a\u000aOr at least that's how I remember it...I may be a bit wrong.

V&gt;The leading secessionists and federalists didn't know the conflict would result in such brutality.\u000a\u000aThis. The Union's army had more people, better manufactured technology, and more generals that were well-versed in strategy. They figured it would be a quick and effortless war. The South, however, rallied around the idea that this war was for their quality of life. While many of the Union soldiers didn't give a rat's ass about the South or if they seceded, the Confederate soldiers all had a common purpose.

VHere's how I think things are going to go between Tobi/Bee/Naruto/Sasuke:\u000a\u000aAs you pointed out, Tobi will come very close to completing the Eye of the Moon Plan. I think he will definitely escape the war with Bee. Afterwards, however, he will have lost his fighting power in the war, and will be severely weakened.\u000a\u000aI'm not exactly sure how it will happen, but he will also capture Naruto and extract Kurama from him. Kishi made it a point to show that the immense chakra of the Uzumaki clan allows them to survive after having a jinchuriki extracted. Naruto has even more chakra than Kushina did, and I think he will definitely survive.\u000a\u000aThat's where it gets tricky. As Tobi has all the tailed beasts, it will be up to Naruto and what will likely be a small, elite team to thwart Tobi's plans before he seals the Bijuu into himself and projects the Tsukyomi on the moon.\u000a\u000aThe series will end with the Ten-Tailed Beast having returned to the world. Tobi will be unable to control the beast and will be killed/taken out of the equation in some way. It will be up to Naruto to battle the Ten Tails in an epic clash that will result in him becoming the Ten Tails Jinchuriki.\u000a\u000aSome small thoughts:\u000a\u000a* Sasuke might be initially sent to capture Naruto after the war, or he will end up fighting him at some point. Sasuke will likely die after having been talk-no-jutsued into being good again. His eyes, which will have evolved into Rinnegan, will be implanted into Naruto so that he may be the true reincarnation of the Sage of Sixth Paths.\u000a\u000a* Naruto will not be Hokage. This manga has evolved from a very childish tale of an underdog's triumph into an adult tale that tackles themes such as world peace and what is moral. Naruto, much like Jiraya, will become a renowned ninja and the most powerful person in the world, but he will not become the Hokage, whose job is to mainly fill out paperwork unless the village is in immediate danger.\u000a\u000a* Bee will die. Gai will die. Oonoki will die. Tsunade will probably die, but may survive. The villages will enter into a stable alliance (at least the five major villages will), but they will not, as some predict, consolidate into one ninja world. There are two problems with that theory: 1) The politics of merging many nations into one while merging many villages into one are too complicated to be solved like that, and 2) there are many minor villages/nations that aren't necessarily peaceful (like Amegakure, which will likely have a Civil War or some sort of violence in the selection of their new leader), may not be quick allies to the Five Great nations, or both.

V&gt;It can be logically deduced, as if things could begin to exist without a cause they would be popping into existence around you infinitely. Do you see any horses appearing out of thin air, perhaps?\u000a\u000aI don't see how that makes sense. I'm not saying that nothing has a beginning, I'm saying that no one could prove the validity of an absolute statement such as "EVERYTHING has a beginning."\u000a\u000a&gt;A suggestion is the same thing as proof?\u000a\u000aHow so? By providing a statement with an unknown truth factor, we cannot logically come to a conclusion. That's like saying "If it's Christmas, then it is December" as a premise, saying "It may or may not be Christmas" as a second premise, and then concluding "It is December." It may very well be December, but it may very well be any other month too. To come to a conclusion, you must be able to determine the truth value of the premise.\u000a\u000a&gt;All you've demonstrated is that you don't know what defenders of this argument say.\u000a\u000aI'll admit that I haven't watched a William Lane Craig video.

The universe has a cause of its existence.\u000a\u000aThis is a completely flawed argument, however, because the first premise, that "Everything" has a beginning to its existence has a cause is not true. To say that absolutely everything has a beginning to existence means that we have seen everything that exists and have evidence to say that it did not exist before.\u000a\u000aThe second premise is equally flawed. "The universe has a beginning of its existence." We do not know that. As awpti pointed out, Stephen Hawking suggests that the universe has always existed.\u000a\u000aSo the Kalam Argument uses two false premises to reach a conclusion, making it an illogical and invalid argument.\u000a

VBecause we, as Americans, like to think that we are becoming more progressive. The fact that there is a state that is so backwards that they vote this law seems completely wrong.\u000a\u000aIn addition, the idea of amending a state constitution is that whatever amendment to THAT Constitution must not be illegal in coordination with federal law. For instance, no state constitution could legalize slavery, because the US Constitution has outlawed it.\u000a\u000aThe First Amendment states that Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, creating a separation between Chruch and State. For a state to recognize Judeo-Christianity as "correct" and legislate based on Leviticus violates that separation. Anti-gay marriage proponents recognize this, so they legislatively argue based on the "definition" of marriage and the idea that children need dual-gender parents to be raised appropriately. Thus, the counterargument using the First Amendment can be construed as irrelevant.\u000a\u000aHowever, when the slaves were freed, one amendment added to the US Constitution, the Fourteenth Amendment (Section 1), states that "No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States." Because marriage is a civil institution as well as a religious institution (justices of peace marry people, they receive benefits from the  government, etc.), that privilege cannot be abridged to the LGBT citizens of America.

V&gt;Marriage is a religious institution.\u000a\u000aYes and no. When we say marriage, we are speaking of two separate things. There's **religious** marriage, which you're speaking of. That's getting married in a church/temple/mosque/synogogue by a clergy. Swearing an oath in the eyes of whatever deity you worship.\u000a\u000aThere is also the **secular** institution of marriage. This is the institution that includes getting a marriage certificate, getting married by a justice of the peace, and gaining many rights, such as hospital visitation, tax laws, immigration status, etc.\u000a\u000aYou are operating under the assumption that "gay marriage" applies to both definitions. It does not. The government cannot walk into a church and force a priest to marry a gay couple if they do not wish to. Likewise, they can't force a priest to *not* marry any sort of couple if they wish to.\u000a\u000aWhen states approve or ban gay marriage, they are approving or banning the secular institution of marriage. This denies equal rights to LGBT citizens, and is thus a violation of the Constitution.

Science gives us its idea (Big Bang, etc.) and religion gives us its idea (God). But there can be alternatives to these. If you're unwilling to believe the science, then answer this: Who said that existence had to begin? Who said existence and the universe has a beginning or an end?\u000a\u000aWithout reading further than your first paragraph, there is already a hole in your reasoning.

VThe entire thing was a cover. He was an associate of Akatsuki before Sasori died. He was able to remain close enough to Akatsuki without showing any of his powers or arousing suspicion.\u000a\u000aWhen it came time to join the Akatsuki in place of Sasori, he acted so eccentric because, as HandyAndy said, no one suspects the court jester is the one running the show. At that point, there were still many Akatsuki with ulterior motives for joining (Hidan - expressing his religion; Kakuzu - making money; Deidara - working on his art; Itachi - keeping an eye out for Konoha). Itachi especially would be a thorn if he had just come out with the real plan. Then there are people like Hidan and Kakuzu who - if they knew that the final objective was the Eye of the Moon Plan - would probably leave.\u000a\u000aSo he continued to stay in hiding. The "underling" Akatsuki members believed that the Bijuu collecting was meant to go towards their mercenary army and world domination. And the world domination was true, in part, but instead of Akatuki dominating the world, it would be Tobi. But they died in different battles, giving Tobi a better opportunity to come out from the shadows.\u000a\u000aMeanwhile, it is unclear whether Nagato and Konan believed that Tobi was really just raising a mercenary army for world domination (which would - in a twisted way - achieve their goal of peace), or if they knew about the Eye of the Moon plan and believed they could divert Tobi's plan before he succeeded. I'm inclined to believe the former, personally.\u000a\u000aAfter Itachi died, Tobi was able to come out of the shadows. Itachi was keeping an eye out for Tobi, as he knew that he was out there (believing he was Madara). But when Itachi died, Tobi was free to act without hindrance, and he even gained an ally in Sasuke, who needed Tobi for his own agenda.\u000a\u000aAlmost immediately after Itachi died, Nagato/Pain went to Konoha to collect Naruto and Kurama. When Nagato sacrificed himself to revive the fallen ninja of Konoha, there was a void in the leadership of Akatsuki, which was down to just Tobi, Kisame, and Zetsu. Because Zetsu knew about Tobi all along and Kisame was already his ally from his stint controlling the Fourth Mizukage, Tobi was able to fill the void of leadership and come out of the shadows.\u000a\u000aAt this point, Akatsuki had already gathered 7/9 of the Tailed Beasts, and had relatively few nuisances to their grand plan - people like Itachi and Orochimaru were now dead. Despite losing 7 of their members (Sasori, Hidan, Kakuzu, Deidara, Itachi, Nagato and Konan), Akatsuki was now in an advantageous position. There was no reason to continue to work in the shadows when more would be accomplished by stepping out into the open.\u000a\u000aAnd that is why Tobi went from acting eccentric and immature to being serious and goal-oriented.

Hell, he earned the nickname White Fang of Konoha (and only the impressive people get nicknames), but we've never seen him.\u000a\u000aWe've seen so many people from past generations in fights: Hashirama, Tobirama, Minato, the Gold &amp; Silver Brothers, the previous Raikage, Madara, etc. who were all dead. We've seen the current crop of kage fight, as well as other powerhouses (Hiruzen, Orochimaru, Jiraya, Kakashi, Gai, B, Naruto, Sasuke). But it seems like the one person who has never gotten any action in either a flashback or a present-day fight has been Sakumo.\u000a\u000aNow, I admit it would be hard to find a place to put him, but I think it's necessary.

VBut that was mostly because the world population has rapidly increased due to further industrialization.\u000a\u000aIn the 1911s, we were still in the industrial era. Now we're in the post-modern era. In many industrialized countries, much of the work we see and do every day is some kind of service (teachers, lawyers doctors, plumbers, electricians, chefs). There are also salesman of all kinds, CEOs, managers, overseers. Today is mostly a service-based economy where most manufactured goods are either produced via machinery or in less-developed nations. Back then, the people in the advanced countries were also the ones making the goods.\u000a\u000aPopulation growth led to the expansion of cities. Due to more food and technology, better medicine, and other factors (ie, the baby boom), the US population was somewhere around 92 million (1910 census). In the 2010 census, the US population was 308 million+. While these numbers are specifically in regards to the US, the trend was uniform across most of the industrialized first world.\u000a\u000aBetween the 40s and the 60s, there was a huge rise in urban population, however, since then there has been more suburbanization. Compared to the 1910s, it seems like we've had a huge rise in urban population, but the urban population (percentage-wise) really peaked in the mid-to-late 20th Century and have started to (slowly) decline.\u000a\u000aMuch of this is due to the new technology available to us. Not only are people now able to work from home (a concept that in the 1910s was absurd), but most working Americans have a car or some form of public transport. It is now just as easy to commute from suburbia to the city as it is to live in the city in which you work.

VI'm not looking at the dictionary for spelling, but for definitions. As for the website you linked, that is Miriam Webster. The definitions of parasitism and parasite are not in sync with each other, so making an assumption that one is correct while the other is not would be presumptuous for either side. Someone should inform them to clarify one of those definitions so that it is more coherent.\u000a\u000aSemantics and words aside, the fact that it's not a different species doesn't make the effect it has on a woman's body any less awful. My point wasn't to talk about the definition of a parasite, it was to point out that carry fetuses to birth is a huge trial and tribulation for people. Some feel that the child is reward enough, but if someone doesn't feel that way, no one should force her to have to go through months of misery to give birth to something she doesn't want.

V&gt; Pro-choice by its very nature takes away the life of a living being, thus anti-life.\u000a\u000aCompletely untrue. Pro-choice proponents aren't saying that women have to get abortions or even that they should. We are saying that the choice rests in a woman's hand, not the government's. Nothing we do takes the life of a living being, it all comes down to what the individual mother chooses. Smoking cigarettes is legal, yet it is harmful. If there was a movement to outlaw cigarettes, I'd be against it because it is a person's right to choose whether or not to smoke. Despite the fact that i think it's bad, it isn't my decision, nor the government's, to regulate it.\u000a\u000a&gt; By your definition, would you say a mentally retarded person should not have as many rights as a "regular person" since some severely mentally retarded people are not able to survive by themselves?\u000a\u000aI assume this is in response to my statement:\u000a\u000a&gt; the life of something that is not aware of itself, does not feel pain, and cannot survive on its own does not have the same rights as someone who can survive, feel pain and be aware of itself.\u000a\u000aI outlined three requirements that must all be met: viability, sentience, and self-awreness. I said that if something meets none of the requirements, it does not have the same rights as something has meets all of the requirements. A mentally retarded person is still self-aware to a degree and is sentient to a degree. Since he or she meets two of those requirements, it is not the same as a fetus, which meets none.\u000a\u000a&gt;Person in a coma\u000a\u000aSame as above. Many coma patients experience the feeling of being in a coma (hearing the voices of those in the hospital room, etc.). Self-awareness? Check. Since it meets one requirement, I wouldn't compare a comatose person to a fetus, so of course they have rights.\u000a\u000aMy statement was that in order for something to possess equal human rights, it must contain any of the following: sentience, self-awareness, or viability. While I consider a fetus a person, it meets none of those requirements, and thus it's rights are not on par with those of its mother, someone who has all three of those qualities. A mentally handicapped person and a comatose person would also meet some of these qualities, so comparing them to a fetus is like comparing apples to oranges.

VWho's definition are we calling official? Because neither Miriam Webster nor Oxford University include the stipulation of different species. And those are the two most accepted dictionaries in the world. Grab the newest edition of either of those dictionaries, and you'll see that I'm not making things up to justify my argument.\u000a\u000aBUT\u000a\u000aFor argument's sake, I'll even adopt your definition of a parasite. Even if the fetus isn't specifically a parasite, it still lives in a woman to obtain nutriment, causing many adverse side effects without any physical trade off. Even if it isn't a different specie, it is parasitic in nature. And thus, a woman should be allowed to decide whether to continue living with the parasitic fetus or to abort it.\u000a\u000aI'm not advocating abortion. I would be happy if no one ever terminated a pregnancy. But women should still have the right to decide to terminate a pregnancy if it is their choice. I know that I wouldn't consider my children parasites; I'd love them. But if a woman doesn't share that same sentiment, then a fetus has absolutely no benefits. To her, it would be one severe inconvenience after another. Whether the dictionary definition of parasite involves two species or not (because despite the fact that Oxford and Webster don't say anything about it, you think that I'm lying), the sentiment and the validity is the same.

I think it's primary function is to promote the idea that destroying the foetus is morally suspect.\u000a\u000aThat's not the point of pro-life. The point of pro-life legislation is to end abortion, not promote an idea. By ending abortion, women no longer have choices about their body, so it does take away their choice. I didn't say that people are only pro-life because they want to take away choices, but taking away choices is the direct result.\u000a\u000a&gt;As an aside it's quite ironic to me that the pro-choice proponents are upset that the pro-life proponents have made a different 'choice' when considering the morality of abotion.\u000a\u000aHas any pro-choice proponent ever forced you to have an abortion or even consider it anything but immoral? I doubt it. We aren't upset about your moral codes. We're upset when you try to put moral codes that are not shared by all of society into a law for said society. There is no pro-choice legislation that says "and a woman must have at least five documented abortions by the age of thirty", and there's certainly no legislation that says "all people must admit that abortion isn't immoral". You can believe what you want and do what you want, as long as you don't prevent others from believing what they want and doing what they want.

VI never tried to demonize anyone. I don't personally know any homophobes or even strictly religious Christians (I live in an area of New York with more Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Hinduists, etc.). I never saw this issue from the Christian perspective, and since I see posts on [/r/atheism](/r/atheism) mentioning these contradictions, I thought I would pose the question to you to get - as I said - your perspective. I'm not trying to make you switch sides or demonize you.

VIt's not that I think it's wrong. That implies that it's a black and white issue. I can find the reasons that a woman would want an abortion to be understandable at times: if rape or incest led to conception, if the pregnancy becomes harmful to the mother's health, even if the mother protected herself and that 1% chance that the condom was bad happened (she was being responsible and shit happened).\u000a\u000aWhen I see high school and college girls having unprotected sex without condoms, birth control, or any other form of contraception, they bring it on themselves, and abortion should not be an option for them.\u000a\u000aI believe that life begins at conception, but viability and sentience does not. An early abortion doesn't hurt the fetus, as it has not obtained sentience.\u000a\u000aHere's where I contradict myself a bit. Despite the fact that I consider the fetus living at contraception, I don't think it's rights trump the mother's rights until at least the third-trimester (when abortion is illegal in most cases).\u000a\u000aSo, I feel abortion in some cases is wrong. I would personally never have an abortion, just because I wouldn't be able to accept that I stopped life from entering the world. But I don't judge people who have abortions if they have justifiable reasons. And even when it comes to those who don't have justifiable reasons, I don't think their right to their body should be taken away.

VThe definition as outlined in the Abrahamic texts are more like the definition atheists use - an omnipotent creator who has a plan and a will who exists outside the natural, physical, and tangible. This god is very clearly a personal god.\u000a\u000aMany "theists" are not "true theists". If they believe in a controlling 'force', like the universe or fate. This is more the idea of pantheism. You can be a pantheistic Jew/Christian/Muslim/Mormon easily. I know many Pantheistic Christians - they follow Christ's teachings, but don't see God as a being, but more as a force.\u000a\u000aAtheists and agnostics tend to look at God as the first definition, an all-powerful creator who exists outside of the natural, physical and tangible with a plan and a will. They do so because, despite the fact that many pantheistic Jews, Christian, Muslims, and Mormons believe in a more impersonal god, a personal god is that which is outlined in the respective books, and these four religions are dominant in most areas of the world (barring much of Asia).\u000a\u000aThe Abrahamic God is descirbed as having omnipotence, omniscience, and omnibenevolance (sp?). Unfortunately, these three qualities clash in a world with evil.\u000a\u000aWhen we look at Christianity, however, we see a special case. While it is considered monotheistic, it is not truly so. While Christians believe in the one true God, they also believe in the Trinity as the three "embodiments" of God - the father (conventional God), the son (Jesus Christ), and the Holy Spirit. When praying, they pray to all three incarnations of God. Then there is Mary. She is God's mother/lover and is prayed to very often (Hail Marys, anyone?). There are also the different patron saints that are prayed to like the gods of old polytheistic religions (because the difference between god of harvest and patron saint of harvest is really just word choice). In fact, in an Italian poll, studies show that the average Italian Christian prays to five patron saints before they start praying to Jesus. Because of this, while Christianity is considered a monotheistic religion, it really is more like a polytheistic religion if anything.\u000a\u000aIf we're not talking about the Abrahamic texts, we have a lot more lee-way in considering the God question. We can consider the deistic definition of God. Due to the definition of deism, a deistic god is one who is still that omnipotent creator, but one who does not have a will or plan. I have never encountered a pantheistic deist who believes that the creator was just a force; I feel like that idea is really just saying that the universe created itself, so I think that's that for deism.\u000a\u000aMost people who believe in an impersonal God tend to be either deistic or pantheistic.\u000a\u000aWe have our polytheism, which looks at a god more like an oversee-er. Depending on the type of polytheism (Greek, Norse, Egyptian, etc.), the creation aspect is taken care of by their respective myths, but gods continue to exist as oversee-ers of the world. For instance, the god of harvest looks over the harvest, the god of the afterlife looks over the afterlife, etc. These gods generally have some supernatural powers compared to humans, but still have rules they have to abide by in their own supernatural realm. For instance, Hades can't snap his fingers and kill Zeus, he has to *do* something. They lack the omnipotence, and usually take on human characteristics (thus lacking omnibenevolence as the Abrahamic god has).\u000a\u000aWe have our different "cult" religions. The ones that come to mind are Scientology (which has scammed the US gov't into getting tax-exempt status while it swindles money) and the Cult of Cthulu (only because I saw a South Park episode a couple years back and looked into it). These cults adopt a special theology, and can believe many things. For instance, Scientology has a creator, Xenu, while the Cult of Cthulu have many different gods who are responsible for everything, and then Cthulu, who is the priest. The list of cults is not limited to this and can thus continue on and on. The main idea here is that cults do not have one specific definition of god, they vary.

V[](/con)\u000aWell, the idea of "Pro-Life" is to take away the choice of the woman. The idea of "Pro-Choice" is not to take the lives of fetuses everywhere. I know that personally I refer to "Pro-Lifers" as "Anti-Choicers" because I myself am Pro-Choice AND Pro-Life. I believe that abortion is wrong - it's something that I would never recommend anyone doing. But at the same time, it is concerning a woman's body, and she has the right to decide what to do with it. It's her choice.\u000a\u000aThe bottom line is that a fetus is a parasite. The definition of a parasite is "an organism that lives in or on another organism (its host) and benefits by deriving nutrients at the host's expense."\u000a\u000aMany people decide to do what is natural and suffer the side-effects of the parasite in the hope that they may be rewarded with a child. Sometimes there's a miscarriage; sometimes the baby is born stillborn; but most people who choose to carry their child to term end up with a live, usually healthy, baby.\u000a\u000aThen there are others who do not want the parasite. It's nine months of awefulness.\u000a\u000a* Swollen/tender breasts\u000a\u000a* Fatigue/Exhaustion\u000a\u000a* Nausea/Morning sickness\u000a\u000a* Backaches\u000a\u000a* Headaches\u000a\u000a* Swollen ankles\u000a\u000aThe list goes on, finally culminating in either vaginal delivery or caesarean section. Whether you push a 5-10 lb baby out of a 10cm wide hole or have to undergo a surgical procedure, it's unpleasant to say the least.\u000a\u000aThat's why - despite my personal feelings that abortion is wrong (I am **PRO LIFE**), I still think it is unconstitutional and unconscionable for the government to deny access to it (I am also **PRO CHOICE**). If any other parasite caused *half* those symptoms, it would be immediately removed. While human life is precious, a person should be free to do with their body what they want.\u000a\u000aTL;DR: Pro-Choice/Anti-Choice is more true to the argument here, not Pro-Life/Anti-Life. No person goes around advocating that everyone should get abortions, while many people go around advocating that women should be forced to deal with a parasite for nine months.

VFell asleep in my clothes around 8:00 only to wake up at 11:00 p.m. I walked into the living room to find my parents were still up. They said something like, "You must have been tired *blah blah blah*." Then they told me to go to the garage; my car was in there, but it wasn't before I fell asleep. My dad then convinced me I moved it in a sort of sleep walking state. I went back to bad until morning when I learned that I didn't actually sleep drive, but my dad had been trolling.

He used connections like musical lyrics about our state (Tennessee) and put push pins on a large map with the song's information. He also ran the school's geography bee in which I got first, second, and third places during those 3 years. At the end of the year, he would add lyrics to known songs but make it about the students and events of the year (I got my own song).

I wasn't trying to defend the confederacy. I meant that slavery, while an issue, wasn't the ONLY reason for succession. Prior to the war the federal government had no intention of banning slavery in the south: the southern states were simply unhappy with the way the north's views conflicted with theirs on a number of issues, including slavery. Again, not defending the south, just trying to add a little historical accuracy to the conversation.

VThere was a post earlier this year about someone doing a WILD that he coined GILD, where the G stood for gravity. \u000a\u000aWhat you do (or at least how I do it now) is when you feel the SP, imagine yourself sinking into your bed because of gravity. That usually helps me. Then again I've only LD'd twice 'cuz I suck =( but try that out!

VThe silly 10cents aside, I do it for another reason. A lot of Starbucks drinks they make it in their own cup and pour it after. What happens is they make too much(since they guess), pour it into their cups and dump the rest cuz no space. So what I do is ask for a small and they end up filling my mug to the top, a medium at least!

VI actually just bought Forza 4 last month and I've been having the same issues. It's not bad with cars under B class because they just don't have that much power (except the is300, that thing...just spins out like mad). \u000a \u000a\u000aWhat I've actually come down to doing is half throttling. Hold the right trigger at like half. And you can keep the line. Once you're past the apex, then you can hold the trigger back down. It works well even if the car has started drifting. Since if you hold it down all the way it'll just end up spinning out. Hold it at half and you can control the drift all the way through.

VI hate this puzzle. I know the answer yet I don't get it...\u000a\u000aA group of people with assorted eye colors live on an island. They are all perfect logicians -- if a conclusion can be logically deduced, they will do it instantly. No one knows the color of their eyes. Every night at midnight, a ferry stops at the island. Any islanders who have figured out the color of their own eyes then leave the island, and the rest stay. Everyone can see everyone else at all times and keeps a count of the number of people they see with each eye color (excluding themselves), but they cannot otherwise communicate. Everyone on the island knows all the rules in this paragraph.  \u000a \u000a\u000aOn this island there are 100 blue-eyed people, 100 brown-eyed people, and the Guru (she happens to have green eyes). So any given blue-eyed person can see 100 people with brown eyes and 99 people with blue eyes (and one with green), but that does not tell him his own eye color; as far as he knows the totals could be 101 brown and 99 blue. Or 100 brown, 99 blue, and he could have red eyes.\u000a\u000aThe Guru is allowed to speak once (let's say at noon), on one day in all their endless years on the island. Standing before the islanders, she says the following:\u000a\u000a"I can see someone who has blue eyes."\u000a\u000aWho leaves the island, and on what night?\u000a\u000a\u000aThere are no mirrors or reflecting surfaces, nothing dumb. It is not a trick question, and the answer is logical. It doesn't depend on tricky wording or anyone lying or guessing, and it doesn't involve people doing something silly like creating a sign language or doing genetics. The Guru is not making eye contact with anyone in particular; she's simply saying "I count at least one blue-eyed person on this island who isn't me."\u000a\u000aAnd lastly, the answer is not "no one leaves."

VI noticed that the cutscenes last BWE were simply just the character, with a moving wallpaper behind them.\u000a\u000aWhereas in GW1, it showed the full environment behind them. While I understand this is probably a huge and lengthy process, I (and I would think many others) personally loved Guild Wars 1 for the fully immersible environment.\u000a\u000aBut in GW2 I didn't look forward to cutscenes as much since they were really more about reading the subtitles, as opposed to enjoying the scene. \u000a\u000aSo I was wondering if you were planning on keeping it how it is now, or if in the future it will be more like the cinematic it was in GW1? (I just remembered that there was a "Work in Progress" sign in the cutscenes. Hopefully that's what it will change to?)

VI'd definitely have to go with Ford. \u000a\u000aA long time ago, my family moved to Canada. All our lives we had been driving Honda's and Toyota's. So now here we are in Canada, and there's SO many White people cars. So we're like, man we gotta get in on that!\u000a\u000aSo we go with Ford because well, it was the closest dealership to our house. So we pick out a Ford Taurus. \u000a\u000a3 Months later the water pump exploded. We replaced it.\u000aThen a month later a strut broke. Okay, we fixed it.\u000aThen not even a month later, 2 out of the 4 cylinders stopped working. \u000a\u000aHere's the worst part: at the left turn to turn into the dealership we got rear ended so hard that the entire back crumbled and the axle broke.\u000a\u000aFord is so bad that we couldn't even get it into the dealership to fix. Never again. Never again.

VI've always thought this should be the way 'countering bad things' should work. I didn't realize it's actually being implemented in places outside of Canada. Here I thought I was smart &gt;.&lt;\u000a\u000aBut I totally agree, I really don't believe in drug laws and alcohol age limit. This is coming from a person who never drinks alcohol and occasionally does weed so, not really biased. \u000a\u000aHonestly, people break the rules, because it's fun. People who are like "I'm 18! I'm going to get wasted!" Why? "Because I can now!"\u000a*Proceeds to get drunk, overdosed; dies.\u000a\u000aThat's why I feel like, if there isn't a law against drinking and drugs, people would be less inclined to try it "to see what the big fuss is all about". \u000a\u000aHell, I'mma even go into speed limits. Hitler's autobahn helped him bring Germany from being one of the most impoverished countries post-WWI, to basically the most powerful. Yes, there's tons of factors that helped stimulate the economy, but his transportation methods (ie: the autobahn) could accomplish shit so much faster. Just like they did in Rome. You know the saying "All roads lead to Rome". Yea. \u000a\u000aHonestly, speed limits on highways are retarded. They're just there for people to try and break. If you had no speed limit, people would just go the speed that they're comfortable with. Obviously, you'd have like a fast lane and a normal lane.

Vi know your not a cop who pulls over people for speeding and stuff but this is just to show what happens when you are polite to the officer who pulls you over.\u000a\u000aI just got my drivers license, so i was doing what every normal teenage boy would do, I was driving fast and aggressive.  little did i know, i speed past a cop (45 in a 35).  Now it was a weekend and i was coming home from Voodoo (a music festival in New Orleans, with lots and lots of weed and acid) cop comes up to me and ask for the usual stuff, i complied no problem. (i was also wearing a shirt that had my schools name and colors on it, when he came back he realized it and said the he had graduated from the same high school, so we wound up having a good 10 minute conversation about how my school came back from Hurricane Katrina.  After all was said and done, we said "I was going to give you a ticket, but you were so cooperative about it, here is a warning."  he then asked when my high schools football game was and blah blah blah.\u000a\u000aTL;DR Got pulled over, befriended the cop because of niceness

VIts people like this that piss me the fuck off, i've lived in New Orleans all my life (16) i've been through countless Hurricanes, including Katrina.  Hurricanes are something you don't want to fuck with.  Whenever a hurricanes come, YOU GET THE FUCK OUT.  i don't care if you lose your house, its better to get out with your life then die with stuff that can get replaced.  I was lucky during Katrina and i was the only one in my family who didn't lose their homes.  i witnessed the house that my mom grew up in get flooded, and then torn down.  \u000a\u000aWho ever this person is, there is a special place in hell for them.  i know what it is like to live in a flood zone. i've seen extreme tides, and the winds?  Thats a story for another day.  \u000a\u000aand before i stop this rant, one more thing....\u000ayou DO NOT piss off the workers that are telling you to leave, they are risking their lives to save yours, you respect that\u000a\u000aok i'm done, let the hate roll in.\u000a\u000adis gon be good

VWe thought the same thing about Issac earlier this year.  We all "believed" that it was going to just blow right over us, turns out it stayed stationary over us for a good 3-5 hours i cant remember.  We already had a lot of water, and MRE's to hold us down for a while (MRE's suck by the way).  most people didn't evacuate for Issac which made lines for Water, MRE's, gas, and other things that we need VERY fucking long, and most people were not able to get water and food until almost a week after the storm passed,  just goes to show why you always stock up for a tropical storm. \u000a\u000a(P.S i know it hit as a Cat. 2, but almost as soon as it made landfall it became a tropical storm, and Katrina was a Cat. 3 when it made landfall.)\u000a\u000aI'll shut up now

It was a complicated process for officials to identify the performance enhancing drugs from the drugs that were helping him beat cancer. In a way, cancer actually benefited him greatly (until now).\u000a\u000aedit: Nvm, he wasn't undergoing treatment when competing. But I still believe his cancer was one of the main reasons why he was not caught.

VI agree with the OP. It didn't have an atmospheric feel like past episodes. Everything felt very literal and straight to the point like a typical NBC or CBS show. It seems like the writers were told to tie up all the loose ends from last season and explain them in as little time as possible in one episode. Then there was also Gus's laptop situation which was awkwardly placed in the same episode.\u000a\u000aI'm crossing my fingers that the rest of the season is on a different level than the season premiere and more like seasons 1-3. I really don't want the greatest show on earth to end up like Dexter...

VSo instead of replying to everyone individually (i.e. I'm lazy) here is some info. I signed up for the beta for the hell of it. This is the first time in about a month or so that I turned my Xbox on. I haven't had gold for 1-2 years because paying $60 a year for multiplayer (which I don't play very much anyway) seemed stupid. I game primarily on PC now. I am planning on getting a PS3 but need to find a monitor that has a working HDMI port (long story, mine doesn't). I don't really have an opinion on browsing the internet via console; if it works for you go ahead. I don't care about breaking the NDA, because, as I said I don't use the xbox very much. Finally, this whole post was just my thoughts on how ridiculous it is that Microsoft requires a gold subscription to use some pretty basic features like sending messages and using something like IE.\u000a

VWhile the Jagdtiger was considered a powerful tank by the German tank commanders who used them, the model suffered heavily from a lack of trained crewmen late in the war, a finicky gun that had to be calibrated often, and a serious transmission-wear problem that caused them to break down quickly from normal use. However, the tank could accurately hit and destroy a Sherman from a range of over two miles.\u000a\u000aAs much as we like to hate on the Jagpanzer IV, its design was so well-liked by the Germans that the West German government had a modernized copy built after the war, known as the Kanonenjagdpanzer. This tank used the same main gun as the M47 Patton adapted for a casemate design.

VI really love his write-ups. In my opinion, I would actually consider "reliability" to in part consist of ease of repair. He mentions that the tank readiness could be skewed by ease of supply, which is true, but I think that might work as part of the evaluation. The Sherman tanks were surprisingly easy to work on, because you could roll the final drive &amp; transmission straight out of the front with two guys and a hydraulic crane. PzV Panthers had to be taken to a machine shop to repair anything. The transmission and tortion bars were hard to get at in the field depending on the damage a tank had suffered (the transmission in particular was always difficult to reach and replace). This essentially made any broken Panther tanks less useful than broken Shermans, because they couldnt be repaired as easily.

VThat's far from true. The major resistance reports came from one man, Wiltold Pilecki, who reported mass killings and atrocities throughout 1940-43 and whose reports were initially laughed at by the allied powers. The rest came from information smuggled to the Poles in Krakow, whom also seemed to think the reports were mind-boggling and unreal until they had gotten the chance to see the camps in reality at the end of the war. Additionally, to say that the camp was "infiltrated at all levels" is highly disingenuous. There were resistance operations at the location, but those operations were confined to Birkenau for the most part, and in particular the prisoners in the camp. The resistance fell apart when the SS began actively finding and killing Poles who were part of the resistance in early 1943. Wiltold Pilecki, the guy I mentioned earlier, was forced to break out of the camp and flee for his life. He told the allies again what was happening and they thought he was bullshitting them.\u000a\u000aAll told, most historians agree that somewhere between 1 million and 2 million people total died at Auschwitz. According to Rudolf Hoess' post-trial writings, he believed that something like a fourth of the people who were reported to his officers dead at Auschwitz died of "natural causes" (like starvation, overwork, disease etc.) and the rest were killed. There is a huge amount of testimony from the prisoners forced to clean the corpses from the gas chambers and those who participated in cremations and other hard labour at the camps that the gassings happened.\u000a\u000aIf anything, the only questionable part about Auschwitz was the report by the Soviets that 4 million people died there, but literally no credible western historian has believed that since 1950. The post-Soviet plaques at the camp have been revised to say 1.1 million total killed, a very conservative estimate.

VThat part isn't particularly related to Ordinary Men. Their main job was to send Jews from their part of the occupied territories to death camps an work camps and didn't see many of them die. You'll be happy to know, though, that they rounded up and shot the rest, and we have bureaucratic records of the Reserve Police Battalion's killing numbers. In fact, many Polish non-Jews witnessed the firing squads, and the entirety of the Reserve Police Battalion's journals and records (and even a bit of postwar testimony) gives evidence of their "Jew hunts" and the sadistic abuse that some battalion members visited on their prisoners and the civilians not yet dead or in camps.\u000a\u000aSo tl;dr read Ordinary Men and try not to be so gullible. :)

The idea of the "dark" native versus the "light" Spaniard was mostly perpetrated through post-revolutionary Mexican art as a way of venerating the academic and government sponsored position of Mexicali (kind of a Mexican racial awareness/hearkening back to the native empires of ye olden times).\u000a\u000ae: Which isn't to say that natives are any less disenfranchised, or that the ruling class isn't descended from mostly Spanish families, but that the inequality was created by hacendados (big land-owners) and their race being the colonial one is merely a consequence of the government allowing the rich to stay rich and continue to control the poor even after the Revolution.

By simply burying it all in a geologically stable area you can essentially leave it and never look at it again. Or use again it in a breeder or LFTR reactor or re-enrich it for weapons (which is bad, but that's where waste went during the cold war).

VThats kinda what I meant. I've got friends who were shot downrange and survived, and they knew folks who got out worse or didn't come home at all. It's easy on the one hand to say "this is propaganda they couldn't have done that" and go on about things, but at the same time if they keep shooting and bombing they still hit plenty of times and that's what makes them dangerous. It's a really bad thing all around.

VThe Theory of Knowledge is a one of the names for the philosophical school of Epistemology, or the study of knowledge. It deals with the essential paradox of greater knowledge implying greater questions and revealing how little one truly knows, and how philosophers and scientists can deal with the idea of learning and how people know what they know, or rationalize the belief that they know what they know is true.\u000a\u000aEssentially, it's impossible for one person to truly know everything. Knowledge of a topic is like a matryoshka doll, the deeper you go the more there is to understand. In my field, History, there is a limit to the amount of obtainable knowledge on a subject, which is based on the age and availability of documents and the inherent unreliability of primary sources. In something like physics or mathematics, while there may in fact be a smallest particle or final equation, the perfect universal knowledge that science tries to find is so unknowably far away that it may as well be infinite. It seems like every time our tools get better scientists figure out that there's something more to see.

VYeah just don't go after dark [here is a link](http://listings.cruisingforsex.com/australia/victoria/sunnyside-beach-10577-details.html#lastpost) to a gay cruising site and sunnyside has some pretty good reviews too.  \u000a\u000aI have lived near a cruising site near Ivanhoe for years and the amount of littering (condoms &amp; porn mags etc.) and public sex that goes on at some of these places is tiresome.   You just want to go for a bike ride and you get two dudes slamming it in some bushes, it's funny, but after the 15th time you just want them to find another place to fuck.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aEDIT: Ah shit NSFW on the link BTW

VTo put it simply, how far are you willing to go?  What drives you to win?  For me I'm not sure I can explain it, it's like a mixture of going to work and the desire to never let him get one over me.  \u000a\u000aPain is temporary, you get kneed or hit, and you think right, I'm still here, let's get on with it let's try and end this thing.  It's all very personal and you have to find your own rationale and your one reason to continue.  For me that's in a fight.\u000a\u000aIn sparring, try this before your sparring session.  Take some time out to make yourself bigger by stretching out your arms and wiggling them about, breathe slowly, relax your shoulders, loosen your legs and forget about your worries. The main thing is relax, maybe start of by worrying about your own movements.  I notice that when I start watching him more when I'm working counters I get him more because I'm too concerned about his timing.  Concentrate on your timing and rhythm and forcing your counters with feints and you may have better luck.\u000a\u000aYou'll get used to it don't worry, besides sparring sessions should be more about technique than trying to take each others head off.\u000a\u000a\u000aEDIT: Also it's good to see more sport related questions popping up rather than just the usual news feed;)

VNick Lundh Fight Promotions in Melbourne Australia.  This is where I had my first fight.  His MMA rules are.\u000a\u000aNo Headshots, No Elbows and knees upon agreement of the fighters, needless to say, no knees to the head.\u000a\u000aIt is Novice MMA, mixed with boxing, MT, Kickboxing and grappling.  It's a big day which he calls **Inter-club sparring**.  Well organised and very grass roots, everyone brings there own gear and it is looked upon as a day of skill building rather than all out fights.  These Inter-club sparring fights have been the stepping stone for our guys in the gym earning their stripes to be able to fight in his Pro Shows and others.  Nick Lundh runs a good show which looks after everyone.  And from what I can tell it just requires a bit of care and though.\u000a\u000aDuring the rules meet, he stresses that their might be some mismatches due to numbers.  He apologies but in the event of a mismatch concerning weight class, he has put a heavier fighter that he trusts in their to keep it friendly.  Although he also stresses that he wants most fights to be at 85%. "We are not here to try and kill each other but to grow in skills.  Save the killer for when you've got the appropriate skills and you are getting paid for it!"  His Refs are all his coaching staff or respected fighters and from what I've seen all are very good.  Many times I have seen Refs warn fighters for inappropriate behaviour and stop fights at the right times.  \u000a\u000aAt my Gym, Team Nemesis of Melbourne our coach never lets you in the ring until you are ready, and fighting at a weight that you should be.  Meaning physically fit, but most importantly technically proficient.  In his words "Our Gym has a reputation to uphold and I'm not about to risk that on someone that is clearly not ready to fight."  \u000a\u000aThese attitudes I think are good examples of people in this sport that think of the lifecycle, of not just the fighter but the fight industry. \u000a\u000aAt first I was disappointed that their were no headshots, mainly because I'd be told that I had good striking and had power behind my shots and wanted to try it out, but after the fight I realised it's for everyone's safety.  No one is getting paid and even if they were it probably won't be enough to cover medical expenses.  So whether I would have knocked him out or it was me getting knocked out, we would have been unnecessarily out of pocket and wouldn't have learnt a thing.  \u000a\u000aEdit: Also, good article!  The more we talk about it and to a wider audience the better people can be educated in safety and the faster these idiots trying to make a quick buck can be weeded out and exposed.  \u000a\u000a

VListen to your coach, always do as he saids, and turn up everyday.  You are learning to use your muscles in different ways, it'll take time but you'll get there.  Something easy that I found to comprehend about Muay Thai, boxing etc. Is that rhythm plays a big part.  Work on basic footwork and combinations and play with the rhythm by shadowboxing (make sure you watch your form though) and working on speed bags.  Shadow boxing I feel has given me a greater understanding of my rhythm when it comes to combos and footwork.  We had a seminar recently with dhazbar and he does an hour of shadow boxing a day.

VDude, I love a car that servers its purpose and the Hilux is perfect at that, I agree.  Although after designing and developing for both markets, it is in my opinion that the engineering quality and level of detail and design that is in German autos is second to none by a very long shot.  So, what indeed I was trying to convey with my comment was that the level of American engineers will never be as good as the Germans, it's in the German psyche.  The way they are makes them exceptional at engineering automobiles, it can not be helped.  This is my *personal* opinion.  But the quality speaks for itself...

VHey, I'm from Melbourne, what suburb are you in, because there are a lot of places in Melbourne that teach MMA, but aren't the greatest.  In Melbourne there really is only a handful of places.  Hit me up if you want my opinion, but if you live in the north.  You should come to Team Nemesis in Northcote, 4 belt holders, legit training staff and a friendly place too.  Also a huge amount of people that just do it for fitness.  If that's too far, I can give you some advice on which ones have legit coaches if you like.\u000a\u000a We have also started an mma self-defense class on Saturday afternoons if that interests you.  \u000a As for your reasons for joining.  If it's confidence you want I guess it could be the right reason, but the best defense is to try and avoid it.  yeah, sometimes that is easier said than done.  \u000a\u000aThe plus side of training your body will be that you might be in a better position to run away, or defended yourself to the best of your abilities.  I would say even if you know how to defend yourself there is still a chance for a worst case scenario, but at least with train you might stay a little more calm which could allow you to assess the situation sooner, and hopefully avoid the situation all together.\u000a\u000aWell, good luck and let me know if you would like some help picking gyms.

VI see where you are coming from, and I agree, even if you do win all the time it doesn't necessarily mean anything, unless you are getting something more out of your experience like growing as a team.  I think it is really important to have great environment where everyone works together to help each other get better, and not just in BJJ.  And it really takes a good teacher, and responsible students help develop teams skill, and promote good attitude.  \u000a\u000aThis is why I have enjoyed this so much, because where I train we have this close and supportive mentally which has seen students develop at an impressive rate, and with a good attitude.   \u000a\u000aAnd personally I think that we take a little bit of pride in the trophies, and our teachers teachers.  To me they represent a respect for where our knowledge of our art has come from, and how it will develop.\u000a\u000aI felt like I got a little deep there, but does that kind of answer your question now about what other schools are like as a community?  We are about 80 and are a big friendly bunch.

VI agree with Rand486 it's the quality of instructor and student that should sell the gym.  At the moment our Gym (Team Nemesis Melbourne) seems to be growing so there is about 80-ish or more coming and going, with a good group of fighters that are regular.  \u000a\u000aOur Head MMA/Grappling coach Denis Kelly just recently got his BB off Carlson Gracie London. Although only a recent BB, he has produced some great fighters.  In a recent event in Melbourne our Team Captain who is a Blue Belt took out gold in the Purple Belt Division, and one of our other top fighters took out silver in the Blue Belt Division as a White Belt.  With one of our other Whites taking out Gold as well.  Thats 3 out of the 5 competitors that day bring home medals.  With the other two placing high in blue belt divisions as whites.  In my opinion that stuff sells a Gym.  And all of them great stand up gentlemen to boot! \u000a\u000ap.s. I feel like I should right some kind of tag line after this! haha, "Come to Nemesis where men are made champions" haha. \u000a\u000a\u000aEdit: Also now, our Gym, Namely our Captain Thomas "Road Rage" Ruderman has a big old target above his head with a lot of the purple belts throughout the city wanting a chance to hit it.  heehee.

VI pretty much try and do it every roll.  of course it's hard to do every roll.  But I try to get myself in bad positions and get out of them all the time, and restrict myself to technique rather than power. \u000aI like it, I find that when, someone wants to roll hard they always get surprised when I tap them several times in the first couple of minutes, especially if they've tapped me easily a couple of times in the past, when I've purposely put myself in tricky situations.   \u000aBut, yeah, for the last 5 months that's all I've been doing.  it's helped immensely, although I guess it's horses for courses really.  I find that I seem to be progressing at a faster rate when I work solely on position and technique in a flow type manner.

VI did my knee a little while ago, not as badly, I kept going to training, and would find myself coming up with innovative ways of doing things when I couldn't use my left leg. \u000a\u000aJust remember to talk to your coach, and he'll be able to let you know what you should be able to do. Mine was really good, and they would ask me everyday how it was going, and if it was a drill that I shouldn't do, we came up with a low impact, or no impact way of doing it. \u000a\u000aWhen rolling I felt like a broken record saying, 'bad knee' every bloody night, and pointy at it, but your training partners shouldn't mind, because they should be able to rely on you later for the same courtesy. \u000a\u000aI found I learnt a lot a different things training injured, because you have to learnt to compensate when you are a whole limb down. \u000a\u000aTrain smart for now, and talk to your coaches, they'll know best about your situation.

Although I believe you will improve better in a school, not just because there is an instructor, but all of your team mates as well, in a healthy environment. i've learnt so much stuff from everyone at my gym. plus depending on the school, it might change to you rolling an hour every night, which is never a bad thing. good luck, and let us know how you go also.\u000a\u000aSorry for it being hard to read, it's from my phone.\u000a

VSome people care about status too much. I don't understand, why you would rather be a better white than, a shitty blue, you're still the same person no matter what your belt colour. People will always be better, or worse than you no matter who or what you are, so what's the matter? I didn't start this art to become a blue or brown or black belt. I started this so I could fuck people up in the ring, belts mean nothing in BJJ if you're going to treat them like grades. That's what attracts me to BJJ, the way I've heard some of the top guys talk about belts is that they are just markers, that's it, and the real achievement is the work you put in. So for me, what the higher belts in my gym represent, is that those individuals have given their attention to the art of movement and control, and they are at a certain stage of learning, what ever it may be, even blacks. That's the beauty of this art, there is no way you can learn everything there is. The belt is just a representation of what your coach thinks, and his acknowledgement of your efforts, and you should respect that. I will be happy when I get a belt of course, because that means Denis has watched me progress to have a better understanding of what my body is capable of. This will make me happy, no doubt, I might even shed a tear. But to worry that I may not be good enough to hang with other blues... To me, this is the biggest waste of time. knuckle down and work if this is a worry.\u000a\u000aTl'dr\u000a\u000aYou shouldn't worry about what colour is around your waist, but what you are capable of doing.\u000a

VThis art has the steepest learning curve I have ever come across, and I'm talking about all disciplines, marital or otherwise.  A good attitude will take you far in most things, so keep it up.  My reason for continuing to do BJJ, well;  One of the greatest quotes of "the gentle art" (Jiu Jitsu) is "When we go to the ground, you are in my world. The ground is the ocean, I am the shark, and most people don't even know how to swim."  This is one reason I keep going to class everyday, because after 1 year I still drown and get eaten by sharks everyday and may always get eaten, but one day, I want to earn the right to say these words to anyone.

VI think this is a very valid post, I have also noticed the rise in injury complaints, not just in r/bjj.  this reason is the reason I don't frequent r/muaythai anymore, sometimes its every second post over there.  I get tired of hearing about injuries, it is the most boring thing to talk and read about, unless it's an exciting one;) If you're hurt don't be lazy and ask the internet, because even if you get the right answer, what are you going to do?! massage the fluid yourself in the wrong way?  work on your own knee? Go find a good practitioner, I go see mine for everything that could be seriously wrong.  if it's minor ice it and move on.  if it's a rash, go get it looked at straight away, you can die from that shit! (in extreme cases) but this sport has way too many injuries to talk about every single one.   Please go see a doctor, and when you see one, if you have done something that you think we should know about, tells after if it's something you think we should know about.

VYep, similar styles make it so much quicker to learn, it will help you start to feel your body having purpose and fluidity, when the people teaching you have a similar style, they can tweak all the subtle movements verbally.

VI've only been at my gym for a year, but how it seems to work is.... When there are a whole bunch of people that seem ready, we do a grading day. you're expected to show up without being told you're grading. we run through certain techniques that you should know, then for white belt 2 stripes which I just got, I was expected to roll for 20 mins straight. That's 4 x 5 mins rounds back to back. So it almost felt like a class. I missed the last grading day so this one I got skipped a stripe, I'm guessing coz they thought I was ready anyway. the higher the level the more grappling time, and from what I hear blue belt grading is intense (haven't seen one yet though) Or coach doesn't seem to be worried so much about how many techniques you know, but more about how well you can use the tools you have. I think this way is best, and it's shown in our results. When the comp guys come back they usually all bring home golds and stories of submission trains.\u000a

VI'm not so worried about belts. My joy comes from hearing the word slick at the start or end of my name. Heehee. Though seriously, isn't it another great thing about bjj that the belts are so far apart that you don't have to worry about them, and it's not about how many moves you know but how well you know them. \u000a

VYes, it's all about context.  You wouldn't see many people saying "ok, this fight I will pull guard, and wait around or attack for a submission".  The guard is to easy to get punished from.  It's a place that you shouldn't really seek, but be very comfortable if need be for offence or defence. In fact you should always move either quickly into the guard and then quickly out if need be.  Always be working for a better position.

VRolling is the key ingredient. Our coach constantly tells us no muscley wrestling, and threatens us with sprints and weighted push-ups if you step out of line or don't grapple.  it works on the whole to keep a relaxed atmosphere in the gym.  Also what we do with the new kids, is when we start rolling they go of to the side and play basic games like passing guard, and mini wrestling tournaments to get use to moving around on the ground.  I would actually miss them if it weren't for the advanced ones we play.

VYeah sure, there are always naturals, but the people that don't have a natural aptitude for certain things can continue training hard, and can find other ways of tackling certain problems.  If there is anything that bjj should teach you, it's this.  There is always a solution to every problem you encounter in a roll, sometimes you just have to take a few steps back and assess the issue.  You may not get it this time but eventually when you keep encountering it, as long as you try and re-assess the problem every time, eventually you will succeed.  Keep practising, if your coach feels you deserve the blue belt then it probably means, he feels your understanding of Jiu Jitsu is growing.  Have a chat with your coach about your issues, he may be able to shed some light or give you some pointers to work on.

VHard work, and tonnes of it.  It all pays off in the end.  Don't worry about things as trivial as getting punched in the face.  Don't get ahead of yourself and start thinking when your first fight is or anything like that, all that takes away from the energy you need to focus on learning.  As for body fat, mma is the best way to lose weight and fast.  When I started to take my training seriously I was 178cm and weighted 112kg in 10 weeks I dropped down 83kg.  Train hard and train often, this is how you'll improve.  Also, make sure you eat right, get enough sleep, and make friends! Go check out a good gym or two as well before you sign up.

VI was having a chat to a nurse friend of mine about the [Paleo diet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic_diet), and from what she says it can be very dangerous if not done right over long periods of time. There are things like [calcium deficiencies](http://www.livestrong.com/article/530538-what-are-the-dangers-of-the-paleo-diet/) and lack of energy due to less carbs, which in my opinion also raises the risk of injury.  So if you are going to use the Paleo diet and are hell bent on it, I would say use a modified version of it, making sure you use good cuts of meat, and to add calcium into your diet, it helps with your weight loss,  [here](http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=56515) if one of a couple of articles that I have come across.  Also the diet doesn't make sense to me because during the time of Paleolithic man, the human race was spread across the entire globe with a huge variety in climate and food so which variety do you pick from?  Anyway, I think that a well balance meal is the best way to stay healthy and lose weight as long as you train hard.  \u000a\u000a

V40 is a great price. But a month in is no time at all in a discipline that takes years if not decades to master.  saying that, I took a couple of private lessons very early on and my coach told me some valuable information that to this day has helped me speed ahead faster than I ever imagined.  if you do take the class it'll probably be just you doing a basic class and going over the basic, its to early to be learning tricks as such.  trust me all of us a month in were getting tapped by everyone, just keep learning and having fun, soon enough you'll be getting subs.

VYes I have been training in multiple disciplines for a little while now, and I think if it's what you are after, go for it.  Even though each style requires different things for your body to be comfortable with, they are all directly related in understanding how your body works.  Even with such differing styles like MT &amp; BJJ.  I find I improve much faster when I am at my training peak and am doing 3 or 4 hours a night,  I find my technique to be crisper and improve much faster in both stand up and ground work.  Everyone works differently though.  If you do decide to go that route, take it easy at first, work your way up to it.  If you feel like at the start you can only manage an hour, alternate days but in the end you'll find it'll be worth it.  Just remember go into every class with as much humility and open-mindedness as you can.  Other than that, enjoy it buddy.  Let us all know how you go.

VWhat I'm trying to say is that slightly above average or even well above average natural skills (yes you have a little training but...) ~~would~~ might not be enough to even consider it a fight, but more of a beat down.  Look, you could get lucky and fight a real dud, but I think what I was trying to say is that's not the real challenge.  The real challenge in MMA is not the fight itself, that's the fun bit.  You get in there scrap and try finish some dude that's trying to do the same thing to you.  If that's all you want, you might as well just go start a bar fight.  The real challenge in MMA and how you define yourself is the long hours, and painful training sessions with out complaint, the constant minor and major injuries that you find yourself training with when you know you really shouldn't.  This is what the proper test is in my opinion.  So I guess what I'm really trying to say is if you really want to try to prove to yourself that you have mental fortitude go and train that's the hard bit.  Go to a proper MMA gym where you train hard or go home.  And from your description of what you've done in the past you haven't done that yet.  So if you want a proper test go beat yourself up in the Gym where ego is left at the door.\u000a\u000aAlso with all the people that you say you've submitted in training.  You realise that training and fighting is different, you may submit people in the gym when people are going 50-60 percent, or are trying for a specific thing which will leave them vulnerable, coz training is not about winning, but about developing your skills.  keep this in mind, when you are training and you will develop much quicker.   It is frustrating sometimes when new guys come in and try and muscle everything around and they don't really know what they are doing and your left just holding them coz you don't want to break them even though you know you can.  Keep in mind a lot of the more experienced guys will go easier on you.  This is to let the up and coming guys learn a little bit so they aren't just coming into the gym and getting beat up. it is a common courtesy.\u000a\u000aIn short just go train.  It'll be better for you in the long run. especially if you've like the sport for this long.\u000a

VIf you don't know how to defend the right attacks standing, and on the ground, your not gonna feel like you were in a fight, but more like you just got beat up.  The guys I train with that have had amateur fights could eat most civilians for breakfast and not break a sweat.  With the little training you've had, it doesn't matter if you've got natural talent or not, considering the "animals" that I know, they'll steam roll right through you.  That been said, if you have the opportunity and it's what you really want? I'm not your mum so go and have some fun! I really mean it!  If your not serious about treating it as a sport this is your best option, so you can say to yourself I did that once.  Although if you do have the raw talent and natural ability that you say you have, in my opinion it is a waste you are not training at an MMA gym, to train for multiple fights!! coz dude if you really are the natural you say you are?  After a **solid** year at a good gym you could be 100 times better, you won't even recognise yourself.  And you'll have a ton more fun this way.  Then just jumping in the ring and "thinking" that you know what you are doing.  Join an MMA gym, what's the worst that can happen? you'll have fun!\u000a\u000ap.s. HAPPY CAKE DAY!

VThis made me really upset, I don't like that attitude and it's plainly disrespectful.  That fighter has worked hard to get were he is and he is giving him an opportunity to.... Argh! stuff it! I'm preaching to the choir.  I'm just upset.  I'm sure the fighter shrugged it off.  As for the drunk idiot he can go home telling lies about how he "beat up" a Thai.  Shit, I'm still pissed.

V4 - 6 nights a week x 2 - 3 hours sessions.  And yes diet and supplements are really important couldn't do it otherwise.  Make sure you have lots of complex carbs to give you energy in training so you can train harder.  Black rice is meant to be the new super food, but brown rice will give you more than enough energy with out filling you up. Supplements Protein, Magnesium powder, Spirulina, Fish oil, Lysine (because I get cold-sores), and a really good multi-vitamin, make sure it's a good one or else you are just wasting money I'd use either Animal Pak or Orange Triad depending on how much money I have at the time.

VWhat I like to do is not get trapped in a guillotine in guard/half guard, or if in half guard, pass guard while they are distracted with your head and move to the opposite side your head is on.  From here lever there arm off, or there is the 'von flute' or a wrestling sub I can't remember the name, but you pull the lower leg furthest away from you (wrapped up from the outside) and their head towards each other. This tears the meniscus and fucking hurts.  It's how I injured myself the night before this fight.

VThat's a good argument, although these fights are designed to give people the most amount of ring experience.  Still, I do see where you are coming from.  The feeling is different.  Technically I finished him twice, and gave him some good GNP with different rules I'm confident I could have finished it there as well.  It was a great win, but after you get stood back up it feels like being in a heavy sparring session.  In fact, the promoter while we where out the back advised us to go at 75% to make it more of a friendly interclub fight, and to allow new comers to enjoy it a bit more, if they were in really bad situations.  Just part of the Novice scene, so not too many people get scared away.

I'd be training really hard up until I got food poisoning a just under a week before and then my knee was pulled the night before doing so light rolling.  So that gave me a lot of fire going into that fight.  I had a lot to prove to myself and I want to do my coaches and team mates proud because we all put so much effort and training into our gym.

VHA HA! Ok I should've explain better. He didn't get out of that guillotine, he actually tapped pretty quick. I had him in a standing guillotine then pulled guard . In Melbourne Novice rules if you tap someone out then you both get stood back up and the fight continues, so really with submissions you are just scoring big points. It's a way of getting more ring experience so your first fights don't end too quickly. That Guillotine would've been 30secs into the first round out of 2 x 2min rounds. So you don't get a lot of time in there.

VActually when you talk about deadening the nerves, that only really deals with the pain of kicking something hard.  What is more important is the micro-fractures in your bones that are created when kicking something hard enough, these micro-fractures heal over with more calcium making your bones stronger and denser.  This is called [Wolff's Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolff's_law).  So when you think about it, killing your nerves before your shins have had time develop into proper weapons is dangerous, because you give yourself a false sense of security that your shins are hard enough when they really might not.  So to the OP kick heavy bags! forget about deadening your nerves, that will come in time.  And make sure you have lots of Calcium and massage the shins to promote blood flood to help the process.  And go to as many Muay Thai classes as you can, there is absolutely no substitute!  Have fun!! \u000ap.s. Wow my first serious reddit post, I feel like I have passed through some strange threshold.

VNews Flash! The feminism movement stopped being about equal rights several decades ago. There is hardly a category in which women are given preferential treatment. Women are given preference in divorce cases, gaining custody a heavy majority of the time. Women are entitled to 1/2 of the man's assets upon divorce. Men have no say in cases of abortions, and are forced to pay child support for children they didn't want. There are several affirmative action programs for women, including scholarships and internships just for being a woman. Feminists are demanding higher wages for jobs that are\u000a\u000a* less dangerous\u000a\u000a* low paying occupations \u000a\u000a* in desirable living locations\u000a\u000a* shorter hours and on weekdays\u000a\u000a* low stress and unspecialized\u000a\u000ato get rid of this so called "gender pay gap".\u000a\u000aThe only thing holding women back now is women. Feminism is a mental disease that teaches you to be a victim of someone else's power. It teaches you to view the world in terms of how an external uncontrollable force is keeping you down. It teaches you that it's okay to expect equal pay for secretaries and engineers. It's the truth that you fear most, but will never acknowledge.

VDeath penalty is uber-expensive, not because of method of execution but because of legal fees that the state has to pay because of the criminal's human right to appeal. $2 million dollars isn't uncommon.\u000aAlso, several people have been put on death roll and were later exonerated for their crimes.\u000a\u000aAbortion:\u000aIt's a shame that people are irresponsible, but people will resort to illegal abortions anyway. Birth control distribution is the most important thing. That said, abortion is a thousand times easier than raising and birthing a kid you didn't want.\u000a\u000a\u000a**TL;DR Death penalty is expensive, and children are inconvenient**

VI had a scientific mind growing up, and while those around me experienced miracles, I saw none. \u000aExample: "I found my keys after praying". Prayer can be a way of calming yourself, rituals tend to do that. With a calm mind, the location of your keys can pop into your mind.\u000aHealing miracles by blessing the sick happened occasionally, but only if they went to a doctor or did what sick people are supposed to. People ignored whenever the miracle didn't occur and the person died from sickness. This is an unscientific bias.\u000aEvery single miracle I've seen has been nothing short of disappointing. The only great ones I've heard of came from 3rd hand sources. And knowing how people tend to spruce up their stories, and even manipulate their own perceptions into delusions, I am unsurprised by any number of miraculous stories.

I might try to bring something funny that happened to me lately and ask them a question related to my story, but I always get limited answers. \u000a\u000aMaybe the real question I'm trying to ask is: do you know any good conversation starters? Anything that can really get two people to talk about that certain thing for a long enough time so that it doesn't end in just less than a minute with an awkward silence?

VI cant really give any evidence, unfortunately. I have just had a lot of experience with people who cut as a cry for help. They try to talk (and sometimes even to the point where its an annoyance) about it with other people so they can have some sympathy and wear t-shirts even when they cut on the wrists. Sometimes it can be quite obvious. This is because of their stressful home life or bad situations they are in, so I cant say its a pathetic whoring for attention. And they obviously need to be paid attention to if they get to the point in their misery where they actually cut.\u000a\u000aBut maybe I only see this so much because Im fifteen and in a high school with too many insecure people.

VUm. Okay I can do this.\u000a\u000aDuring a violent hurricane, a line of outhouses get caught up in the storm resulting with feces flying this way and that, eventually turning into a giant mound of soaking crap. Meanwhile, on the other side of town, a scientific experiment goes wrong and explodes, sending harmful radiation into the air. This radiation is sent all across town and manages to fuse itself with the mound of feces. With it's powers combined, it turns sentient, and it chooses an Irishman who happens to be the nearest one to this flying sentient mound of shit. Sharing it's powers with him, the Irishman turns into a superhero. What is his name?

VI have never been in your situation, so I guess I shouldn't be saying I know how you feel. But I have, (to an extent) felt the hopelessness, the wanting to die and thoughts of killing myself going back and forth in my head that I felt like you have when I read your story on Suicide Watch. Now, this is going to sound like the ordinary cliche horse shit you may hear when you tell people about these thoughts. But life is pretty worth it. I really, really challenge you to get a new angle on things. Try to get out in nature and enjoy yourself. Find things you enjoy (which is difficult, I know) and different hobbies that can keep you busy. You know, find something you can commit to. It can be anything. Camping, music, cooking, drawing, science research, programming, building things, etc.\u000a\u000aI really hope you get out of the state you're in now and the state you have been since you were a kid. I also hope you don't end up killing yourself, even though it seems inevitable and useless to just hold it off till later. \u000a\u000aMuch love and positive thoughts from Canada. Once again, I really hope you start a better life soon. :)

VWhen I was pretty young, about seven or eight years old, I was in a scouts camping trip, in a cabin for the night. I was pretty tired so instead of getting snacks just like all the other kids, I climbed into my bed. I sat down on my covers watching everyone eat and talk. Suddenly, everything was dark. Everyone was in bed. I heard someone snoring. I was in the exact same position as before sitting on my covers. It was as if time just skipped ahead. My head was full of fuck. I looked at someone else's watch and about 4 hours had gone by. I fell asleep, confused. The next morning, I asked people what happened to me the other night. They mostly just said stuff like "Nah, you were just eating snacks and we told stories and that was it. Don't you remember?"

Anyway. I handed it in at the end of the class. \u000aI got a 100 fucking percent. \u000aThis teacher has never given marks like that. He never gave a 100 percent in his 15 years in teaching.

(because y'know, it makes you dumb, it's illegal, yadda yadda) We were blissfully strolling the town following our friends, who were talking about god knows what. We got a big bag of all dressed chips and then we decided to lie down and look at the stars. (it was at about midnight) After one of our friends got us burgers, we talked about how we should someday escape this physical world and into the endless nirvana. afterwards, we went into my friENT's house and played mario kart and watched jackass 3.\u000a\u000aEdit: we only did a bowl though...

V"If every movie was like that, they would all look like shit" well, if all movies were like that, that would mean directors, actors and storywriters have more talent in general anyway. Then, even better movies would come from extremely talented directors, actors and storywriters. And it doesn't have to be a recent phenomenon, I just want a decent script and acting. Merely explosions and special effects just aren't my cup of tea anymore after seeing so much of it like in films such as 2012 and transformers. It's okay if you think I'm a movie snob because of this.
